I had to confirmed my identity on the XXXX website and the XXXX website to obtain the information about the child support payments. 
I called the phone number listed on the XXXX Website and requested a new card after confirming that was the only way I could have access to the money. 
I made the call on a Thursday, paid extra for XXXX delivery, received the card on XXXX XXXX a Tuesday, followed the instructions to setup my pin number. 
After I setup the pin I attempted to pay my car insurance with the card and the transaction was declined. I thought that was a mistake because the balance on the card at the time was {$10000.00}. 
I called the number listed on the back of the card XXXX waited for XXXX minutes. Spoke with a customer service representative ( XXXX employee ) with a distinctive raspy un-clear voice who explained their was fraud and she needed to confirm my identity. Well I explained I just received the card today and just setup the pin how could fraud occur. The customer service rep said the state of NJ reported fraud because I changed my address, but just had to answer a few identity questions. Because of the representative 's un-clear raspy voice I would have to ask her to repeat her questions. Well after the XXXX question she told me her system timed out and I could fax proof of my identity wait 1 hour after faxing then call the customer service number. 
I faxed my identification the very next day, XXXX XXXX 2015 Wednesday waited XXXX hours then called the customer service number only to realize I had been blocked from accessing my information online and by phone. I called the XXXX number I automatically received a recording telling me about possible fraud and I should receive a letter in XXXX days. Online I automatically receive a fraud alert when I typed in my user id. 
Eight days passed before I received the letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2015 with a fraud unit phone number XXXX. I called the number and spoke to the same customer service rep. I told her she sounded like the same person I spoke to at the customer service number, she confirmed she was. She also confirmed there was no fraud, due to the balance on the card they wanted to again confirm my identity. I was furious. I told her I had faxed my identification XXXX days ago and no one responded. Well while I was on the phone she located the faxed documents, My NJ drivers license, government work identification, and a letter from social security confirming my social security number and she unsuspended the card. 
This all happended two weeks ago, I attempted to use my card on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and my card is suspended again. I am blocked from accessing my information online at their website and if I call the XXXX number I get the automatic recording. 
Alleged fraud XXXX in less than a month? Consistently blocking me from accessing my information online. Blocking me from actually speaking to a representative. This is ridiculous, they are holding my child support money hostage there is no fraud. They are fraudulently claiming fraud.

I tried to use the one I purchased on XXXX/XXXX/2015 on same day due to my previous card being drained by fraudsters before I used it, but it was declined saying that it was not activated. I faxed in required information for activating it. Later, when I tried to use the gift card at a XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX/XXXX/2015, the purchase was declined. When I checked online I found that it was fraudulently used for a purchase of {$490.00} at XXXX in XXXX, CA on XXXX/XXXX/2015 while I still have the possession of my gift card. I did not even know it was activated and the funds were drained. 

I faxed all the necessary documents to US Bank. It seems like something is really wrong with these prepaid gift cards that makes it so easy for fraudulent transaction while we still have possession of the card. I would suggest everyone not to buy these US Bank Gift cards to avoid this hassle and being out of your funds for several months.

I did not activate the card. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter in the mail from Blackhawk XXXX notifying me that my debit card may have been compromised and they were sending me a new card which I received in XX/XX/XXXX 
Around XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the myprepaidcenter.com web site to activate the card. I discovered only {$2.00} credit remained on the account. I called a Blackhawk representative and he stated that two purchases were made on the XXXX web site on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$83.00} and {$39.00}, respectively. The representative told me he would send a dispute form in the mail for me to fill out and once received by XXXX, the account would be credited the full amount of {$120.00}. 
I never received the form, so I called again on XX/XX/XXXX. This time I spoke to XXXX XXXX. She said she would email me the form that day.

Each letter was for one of the two XXXX purchases. 
I feel this has been a scam all along. I never activated the original card, but yet someone allegedly used the account to make the two purchases on XX/XX/XXXX Blackhawk never indicated at the beginning of this issue that I had to fill out a dispute form. They just sent me new cards and never indicated I had to fill out a dispute form.

07/29/2015,Prepaid card,Transit card,Fraud or scam,,"Dear American Express Representative or To Whom It May Concern : I am a XXXX year old, XXXX male, and a retired U.S. Military Veteran. 

I acquired and employed your services less than a year ago when a colleague had recommended your service being AMEX EXPRESS SERVE CARD/ACCOUNT services which was intended to protect my finances and enable me to have my military payments from the U.S.A Federal Government be Direct Deposited to my account/card. 

I did this because since being back home to the states, I have been victim to XXXX / XXXX and XXXX on XXXX occasions. Since I have been back and attending school, I have also been working and filling in for my former trade in the XXXX XXXX XXXX. That being noted, I often have no other choice than to have to carry cash or often make cash deposits after the end of my shift. This alone, not to mention the other added benefits of being an AMEX CARDHOLDER Member and the online banking and fraud protection, and ability to have my U.S. GOVERNMENT/ GI SUPPORT Directly Deposited to one of your banks with my serve account is why I employed your services. 

My card & wallet was stolen on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Upon not being able to find it and then seeing the online charges posted at XXXX and XXXX 's totally in the amount of {$870.00} in Fraudulent Charges. ( not including transportation and record fees adding {$26.00}. ) I called AMEX and the police THE SAME DAY. ( Incident Report # XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Police, by XXXX XXXX ) I have made countless calls to multiple departments within your company. I have followed all the correct procedures with contacting you and the police department for this given situation. From the time of calling for the local police for the larceny to having to acquire transportation to each individual Police Department where my card was fraudulently used and had to meet with multiple Detectives. Having done this and agreeing to press charges to retain my lost earnings since my GI Support Payment is what pays my rent. I am facing being behind on rent and potentially eviction. Not to mention other fees I have incurred like late payments, lost wages, not to imagine yet what it may cost for legal fees I will incur as I pursue this matter. As I have been ignored, continuously time and time again, by nearly all representatives I have spoke with and promised this would be "" escalated to upper management with a promised call back within 48 hours '' - THREE times now since this has occurred. 
Initially, I was told I would have a complete refund within 7-10 business days back to my account for all of it, and the lesser charge even sooner, as it was under {$500.00}. 

Not only have I faced such a situation and ordeal with your company ( AMEX ), I was denied my claim for these fraudulent charges, while I have worked countless hours in regards to investigate and aide your company in my loss and identity theft, but I have also provided reports with the multiple Police Departments being able to successfully acquire clear video surveillance footage of these fraudulent purchases taking place by a stranger that is clearly not me, being a white male ( Accomplice and Burglar, XXXX XXXX, who is currently incarcerated on unrelated charges ) making the purchases. They, nor did anyone, have permission for any such authorized use or possession of my card. The police have even arrested and interrogated these people. Some of these Detectives involved with this case have spoke with AMEX, one call I witnessed in person at the Police Department. 

How AMEX Investigators came to find the my claim should be rejected as claiming "" the charges were authorized '' is beyond me considering the ample evidence that is VERY CLEAR and STRAIGHTFORWARD that this was not me and was the person reported to have stolen it. See attach..

On the XXXX of XXXX 2015 we tried to use the card but it had not been properly activated at the point of sale so I contacted the card issuer ( US Bank, mygiftcardsite.com, XXXX ) website and and told them the problem and they said they would activate the card after I sent them a copy of the front and back of the card along with my contact info. XXXX days later I called the toll free number and used the IVR to see if my card was activated. I discovered that the card was active and had a {$78.00} charge ( at XXXX ) put on it in XXXX California on XXXX XXXX 2015. I live in XXXX and I have the card which I received in a sealed package from my brother. I told them that I did not make the charge and they said the card had been compromised and they said they would disable the card. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and my call was dropped. I called a XXXX time and to verify that in fact the card had been disabled and again asked to talk to a Supervisor. I was connected to someone who was garbled. I hung up. This all took at least an hour. 
A week later I received an affidavit to sign to dispute the {$78.00} charge. Today ( XXXX XXXX 2015 ) I called to get status. After waiting XXXX minutes in queue, I was told that the card had a XXXX balance. I asked how that could happen because the card was supposedly disabled on XXXX XXXX. The CSR stated that there were XXXX additional charges in California, on XXXX XXXX 2015 at XXXX {$8.00}, on XXXX XXXX at XXXX {$11.00} and XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX {$.00}. These charges came after the card was supposedly disabled and I verified that with XXXX different CSR 's on XXXX XXXX. So I had to amend the affidavit and re-fax it to the disputed center which I did today. 
I feel that this company or some of their employees are commiting fraud. I do n't know how anyone in California could have gotten the card info unless someone at the card company gave it to them. The CSR that at the dispute center ( a third party ) stated that this company ( US Bank ) has the most disputes of any of the companies that they service. Her name is XXXX and she can be reached at XXXX. I recommend you call early otherwise you will be on hold for a very long time. 

P.S. the toll free number on the gift card to call for customer service is incorrect. If you go to their website ( XXXX ) it now shows in big red letters the correct number. 

This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. I recommend that people send cash or a check, forget the gift card. At this point my time is wasted on this is worth much more than the {$100.00} gift to my mom. 

Thanks.

09/18/2015,Prepaid card,General purpose card,Fees,,"I was charged a {$2.00} per month service fee which I believe is illegal under Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( H.R. 627 ). 

Title IV on gift cards : '' it shall be unlawful for any person to impose a ... service fee ... with respect to ... general-use prepaid card '' Exceptions : a ) The fee starts *seven months* from issuance therefore it does not meet that exception. 
b ) disclosure requirements are met ( see below ) c ) N/a ( there is only one fee per month ) d ) I will refer to Bureau experts on additional rule-makings ( 3 ) Disclosure req. 
a ) Clearly and conspicuously states : ( i ) that a fee may be charged - this is *not clear nor conspicuous* as the only place it was mentioned was in the verbiage of the terms sheet which no consumer reads and on the back of the card ... so I had no reason to look for it until I checked my balance. 

( ii ) the amount of the charge - this is clearly listed on the back of the charge but it is *definitely not conspicuous* especially when I was aware that charges on prepaid cards are illegal I expected extra-ordinary notice with references to these exceptions. 

( iii ) how often such a fee may be issued - the term on the boiler plate of the back of the card states "" monthly '' I do not know if that meets the specificity requirements here. 

( iv ) *** The term does not list this as an inactivity fee just a service charge but that is exactly what this is. 

( B ) "" the issuer or vendor of such certificate or card informs the purchaser of such charge or fee before such certificate or card is purchased, *regardless of whether the certificate or card is purchased in person, over the Internet, or by telephone. * '' I was not made aware of these fees before I received these cards from rebates. Moreover, given the media attention this act received the default position is that there are no fees so any fees need to receive explicit notice ( s ) in order to be clear and conspicuous given the context. 

I spoke with Supervisor XXXX of the Rewards Team Ext : XXXX who even after I explained why these terms are illegitimate said they would not reverse the XXXX {$2.00} charges as a response to the law or as a courtesy due to the terms and conditions. 

These sort of fees which fly in the face of the spirit of the regulations in place to protect consumers also violate the letter by not informing recipients before they receive the card and not clearly and conspicuously stating terms. As I 'm sure many people go by the expiration date and when they go to use their card it is declined for insufficient balance and they find themselves with less than half there expected balance. 

Currently the back of the card tells you to go to americanexpress.com/reward or call customer service. And the website tells you to call customer service number listed on the card. This is classic diversion and time wasting tactics to keep consumers ill informed. 

This deceitful practice grants American Express and and other prepaid company a windfall of XXXX dollars in the form of {$2.00} per month charges times up to 6 years. 

The CFPB needs to be strict on these cases because it is not worth disputing {$2.00} at a time for the consumer but millions are being stolen this way.

All XXXX were based in the XXXX and spoke with heavily XXXX XXXX, forcing me to ask several times for them to repeat themselves, as well as for me to have to repeat myself while speaking slowly.

The second time I called and requested a supervisor, I was told s/he was preoccupied and would return my call at a later time, only for me to not receive any calls back.

I did finally figure out it was linked to the doctor and activated the card to pay a co-pay, but there have been issues using the card, so I called to try to cancel it and get the balance back. On the first call, the agent put me on hold for a while, the told me she was transferring me to management. Instead I was disconnected. I called back and the agent was somewhat more helpful ; she also put me on hold for a while, but did come back and appeared to be about to process the closure. She informed me that there would be a {$5.00} fee to send me a check and implied that was the only alternative, even though I asked for others. I protested that I should not have to pay to receive my money on an account I never asked for. She again put me on hold, then came back and confirmed that there would be a {$5.00} fee. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold for quite a while, with the agent checking in periodically. She finally came back and said all the supervisors were busy and rather than keep my holding, they could call me back. I asked for a call back within an hour. That hour passed, so I called back. I did notice that my balance had been diminished by {$2.00} from my original call. This third agent was at least somewhat helpful in that he told me that there as a {$1.00} fee per call ( the 2nd agent did not tell me this when I told her I would be calling back if I had not heard from them in an hour ) .He also told me that I could close my account without a fee by going to a BofA location. There is not one near me. I again asked to speak to a supervisor to now ask for the {$3.00} call fees to be credited in addition to the {$5.00} check fee. The supervisor, XXXX XXXX, informed me that he had already closed my account with no credits for the fees, claiming that that was what the agent made clear I wanted and that I had agreed to the fees. He said that it could not be undone at this point. I had never agreed to the fees and that was precisely why I asked to speak to a supervisor! He said that he would submit my request to the Debit Card management, and it would be up to them if any of my requests were honored, but because the account was now closed it was out of his hands.

I pulled and reviewed the XX/XX/XXXX Statement and saw my account still at {$31.00}, but my son 's account was - {$460.00} and showed a NEW debit on my son 's card for {$490.00}. The new debit had the exact same date and transaction number as the original debit in XX/XX/XXXX. What is different is the transaction ID/approval code from AmEx. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with AmEx trying to find out what was going on and after being transferred 3 times between their fraud and billing departments was told to work it out with the vendor. I called my son who took the statement copies to the vendor and he was told it was a processing error and it would be taken care of. Needless to say, the holidays came and went without the error being taken care of. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I called AmEx again to find out why my account was still negative if the vendor agreed to resolve negative balance and found out my son 's account was locked. After almost 3 hours on the phone and being 4 times between their fraud and billing departments, I was told : It was outside the limit of time AmEx could dispute the transaction with the vendor ; just pay the balance due and we can move forward, try to work it out with the vendor or just write it off. 

XXXX with AmEx placed a call with me to XXXX at XXXX XXXX and tried to explain the negative transaction of {$460.00} ( my son had {$25.00} in his account when the phantom {$490.00} debit hit ) transferred to my account - which is NOT the transaction in question. Ginger asked for and I sent copies of the statements. She reviewed them and contacted her card processing company ( WorldPay ). On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX with an update from XXXX 's card processor claiming the account was not debited a second time by XXXX and advising me to dispute the transaction with my financial institution. That is where I 'm at now. Please help me, thank you.

04/13/2016,Prepaid card,General purpose card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,,"I have been in a continued struggle with American Express Serve regarding a charge on my account. On XXXX XXXX a charge was placed on my account for the amount of {$200.00}. I was told by the merchant on XXXX XXXX that due to an issue with their billing system as well as several issues during my stay I would not be charged. I attempted to get the charge reversed and was even told by the assistant manager that she would reverse the charge but only the XXXX could process it. I was unable to resolve the issue directly so I then filed a dispute with American Express. I received an email asking for necessary information regarding my dispute which I provided as well as contacted American Express and explained the entire issue to a representative which I believe misfiled the dispute because then it was closed on XXXX XXXX because they said they did n't receive any info. I requested the dispute to be refiled and the dispute was n't refiled until a month later. During the entire process I spoke with numerous supervisors who on each call gave me a different story on my dispute but we 're all just excusses on why I was still waiting. I was also promised a provisional credit by American Express which was not honored. I then spoke to a representative and supervisor who told me that the merchant agreed to refund the charges which have not yet been refunded. Then today I spoke to a representative who told me that was also not true and that the dispute was still in progress even through it has been over three months since the charge was originally placed on my account. I also have all conversations with American Express recorded in compliance with my local state and federal laws when the representative promised a credit as well as being told that a refund was going to be issued.

What I found was not pretty. I did a XXXX search for this particular company ( there are a couple of different Reloadit companies ). What I found was disturbing..numerous people have posted problems with this company. Some of the people who requested refunds were declined because Reloadit said the pack had already been posted to someone elses account, but according to the customer, the only people who had all the info needed to do that was the person who bought the pack AND the people at Reloadit that requested all the info on the pack. I believe there is a major problem with this company. I feel any and all sales of this companies Reloadit packs should be halted until this is investigated. I have notified XXXX Prepaid of this issue and they have taken my comlpaint and escalated it to Urgent status. There are enough complaints out there that I believe all of these Reloadit packs from Blackhawk Network California should be removed from sale. Some of the existing complaints mention that their website was hacked and a fake website set up to scam information and money. Anyone who buys one of these cards is probably going to lose their money. This has been going on for months..why these Reloadit packs are still available to purchase is beyond me. They should all have been removed from the marketplace.

The next day she sent the item to me anyway and told me that I would need to be a XXXX % stocking fee but that once I received the item, if I sent it back she would give me a refund minus the stocking fee. I was angry and I immediately called up my bank and told them to stop any transactions form this seller ( and even paid the fee ). I had assumed that she would n't be able to charge me anything. When I got the item I sent it back to her and I got an email from her a week later saying she sent me a refund. 

I was immediately confused .... I did n't understand how she sent me a refund, if I had blocked the transaction from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account. Come to find out that she sent the refund via pay pal. I immediately thought that maybe something went wrong with the transaction, when I searched pay pal for answers, I saw that the refund was listed as "" gift money '' or money that I could obtain to be used toward anything. I did n't touch the money because I was confused about how I had this "" extra '' money. I checked my XXXX XXXX XXXX and saw no changes in my account. I went back on Pay Pal and saw that I had a "" XXXX balance ''. I assumed that this meant that the seller just made an error and issued a refund on an item that she never received money for. 

Months later, I keep getting emails from pay pal about "" billing '' statements. I click and see that I have a XXXX balance STILL, and that I still have the partial refund from the seller sitting in the "" account '' for use. So I assume that with the zero balance and with the refund money sitting as a "" credit '' that the statements I 'm getting are really about the refund money, and not about an actual purchase. 

Then last week I got a call from a bill collector about Pay Pal Credit. I was immediately confused. I NEVER signed up for Pay Pal credit. I NEVER gave them my SSN. In fact when I signed up for Pay Pal to purchase the item XX/XX/XXXX, I only gave my credit card information, my address, full name, etc, an email address and asked to purchase the item with my XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( which I later deleted to keep the seller from charging it after I cancelled the item ). Yet I was STILL signed up for this service, given a credit line, and received no paper statements or any information about this account. 

The emails that I received and "" statements '' always showed a XXXX payment due, XXXX balance, and XXXX "" credit '' ( from the partial refund ). So I was NEVER given information that stated that I owed anything, and that there was a specific payment I needed to make. 

When the creditors called me and told me that I owed {$340.00} dollars and that it was past due. I was confused. Not only did I not sign up for this service, but in statements and on the account it showed XXXX payment due, and XXXX balance. Now I owe {$340.00}??? 

Half of this amount is late fees and interests. 

I 'm angry that I was illegally signed up for this service. That I was charged late fees, and interests on a purchase using an account that I never authorized. That I was never given descriptive statements that showed me late fees, interests, or balance owed. And that this is on my credit report despite me not giving permission or authorization.

Calling the company requires interaction with an automated voice system and the only way to get to a person at all without getting kicked off the call is to select an option that is not for the reason I was calling.

Because I am very concerned about my identity records, unwarranted liability, and financial vulnerability, this has taken my time and attention trying to reach the company to scold them for sending me this card and demanding that they remove my information from their system.

I am filing this complaint for the financial and privacy reasons stated, but primarily because of the stress of receiving the card in the mail at all and feeling that I needed to do something about it right away, although it is wasting my time to do so. 

Thus far, the company has prevented me from complaining to them about their actions and I find that grossly unacceptable. Their computerized phone interaction is unfriendly and dismissive at best, not allowing me to accomplish what I called about at the number they publicize on their web site and on the back of the card they sent. 

There is very tiny print on what I got in the mail giving information about how to decline the card offer and/or opt-out of future mail offers from netSpend. It is tucked away and does not address the problem I am reporting. I should not have to ask not to receive such mail with a personalized card enclosed.

Recently I had a total of 6 cards that were "" compromised '' within a day of me purchasing them. I always examine the packaging, so I know this was not a case of them being tampered with in the store. This has happened to me and others many times, as the sequence is laughably weak on these gift cards. The security measures to prevent people from brute forcing card numbers is nonexistent. All of my cards which were compromised shared 12 out of 16 numbers, in some cases 13 or 14 numbers were shared. 

When these cards are compromised, the process is fairly easy ( I guess because they 're used to dealing with it happening ) to "" lock '' the card so no further fraudulent transactions can be made. The process for asking for a replacement card is much more tedious, and can take months to complete. Not only that, when you receive your replacement card, it will have {$6.00} taken off of it as a "" fee ''. This is not acceptable in my opinion, and borderline fraudulent. They reap probably millions in fees because they do n't take the necessary precautions against people obtaining and being able to guess their card sequencing. 

For this reason, I have opted to pursue a resolution to my compromised cards through the CFPB rather than reaching out to U.S. bank and waiting for months to receive less than I originally paid for on my cards. I am attaching scans of the cards and receipts where they were purchased by me. Please reach out to me if you have a need for further information.

No other information was given to me over the phone and I was told that a supervisor or manager is not available. So I hung up, and while being surprised, waited for the promised email. Email showed up promptly and all the explanations it had was that my account was closed because activities were noticed that were in violation of sections XXXX and XXXX of Prepaid REDcard Member Agreement. I carefully read those sections of the agreement and could comprehend how activities on my account have been in violation of those terms. So I called Account Protection line again and this time after insisting that I need to talk to a supervisor, I was finally connected to a supervisor. He first told me the account was closed because they could n't verify my checking account information. I told him there is nothing with the checking account that can not be verified. It is a personal account solely in my name, it is already completely verified in American Express Prepaid XXXX website and I have been using this checking account without a problem, and they could have contacted me if they needed any type of further information. He told me about the emails they sent me asking further information, and I told they never sent me such an email about this issue. Looking on history of the account, the supervisor could n't find any track of an email that was sent to me regarding this issue, nor could he tell me what part of the information might have been needed for verification. Then he changed the story and told me that account activities were in violation of Prepaid REDcard Member Agreement. But when I asked him about which activities were in violation of Prepaid REDcard Member Agreement, after putting me on XXXX long holds he could n't come up with an answer and just told me some account activities were in violation of Prepaid XXXX Member Agreement, and advised me to go to Police if I need further information and initiate the process of asking for further information from there! 
So my American Express Prepaid XXXX account was closed for no clear reason, without any prior warning, without asking me for any information ( if they needed something ) and all I was doing with this account was completely within Prepaid REDcard Member Agreement. 
I have enclosed XXXX PDF files containing the Prepaid XXXX Member Agreement AND a copy of most recent bank statement for my checking account at XXXX Bank.

What followed has been a draining, unending experience. {$3000.00} was frozen in my PayPal XXXX card, which was unrelated to my PayPal account.

On XXXX XXXX, PayPal promised they would send a check within XXXX business days, giving the following message : "" Your PayPal My Cash Card refund request has been successfully processed. You will receive your check by mail on or before the next XXXX days. '' The ticket # was XXXX. I waited over a month, but no check arrived. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called their customer service hotline ( XXXX ) and discussed my situation with CSR XXXX.

I emailed them with all requested information on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and verified that they received all required personal information. After that, three weeks passed without any response regarding the refund from PayPal. They were supposed to send the check within two weeks. 

So on XXXX XXXX, I contacted a CSR by the name of XXXX from the compliance department and requested an internal investigation into the refund process.

I waited again until XXXX XXXX, 2015 and spoke with a supervisor by the name of XXXX and requested a check on the status of the refund, and he said that XXXX never sent an email to the compliance department, or the compliance department never processed my request. The supervisor XXXX promised me a refund within XXXX business days, but neither response nor refund at the time of writing this ( more than XXXX days ). 

Every time I have called PayPal, they have put me on hold for at least XXXX minutes. PayPal has kept over {$3000.00} of my money since XXXX XXXX, over XXXX days. Unacceptable. This reeks of fraud and scam. This is beyond reproach for such a large business. Never before have I dealt with such incompetence that it seems only plausible that they are manipulating customers for gain.

Because I have banked with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and before I can report my debit card lost and stolen they always called me on my phone to tell me that some one is doing fraud on my debit card and even though I have lost my debit card more than once, they were always nice enough to issue me a credit or a reimbursement. The only reason why I am not using a bank and why I just American Express as a prepaid customer is because American Express does not charge me a monthly fee to be a customer and does not require a monthly balance. 

If my wallet was never torn and I had a job and I was not living in a group home, having limited assets, getting paid social security once a month because I am XXXX and I have to pay rent to the group home otherwise I will be kicked out and I do n't get that much of money from Social Security, then I would never loose my cards in the first place and I will still be able to do business with American Express, because I wo n't have to be disputing charges and then they think I am doing identity theft or trying to scam American Express by saying I did n't make those charges by saying reimburse me for that money when I say send me a new debit card, when they have no prove that I lost my debit card. American Express is very unprofessional and violating the government regulation law when they are regulated by the FDIC because even though I get them a police report, they wo n't even investigate it or give me my {$9.00} back since there back office told them not to all because they closed my account and they do n't want to do future business with me ever again, but my friends have had a bank account or a credit union and have disputed transcations that are not there 's, especially if they can provide a police report and the bank or credit union has always returned the money back, if they did n't made those charges and protected them from identity theft, instead of blaming them that they are just trying to scam the prepaid banking department so they can get there money bank and cancel there card on purpose and abuse the system on purpose when they have no evidence when I really lost my prepaid debit card. And how will they know that I lost my prepaid debit card and I am not trying to get my {$9.00} when they would not take a police report from me. I mean, American Express was rude to me and said they do n't care if I report them to the new 's media that they wo n't give me back my {$9.00}. And I do n't want to take them to Small Claim 's Court if Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or XXXX ca n't force them to give me my money back but maybe use publicity to embrass them for having terrible poor people and interpersonal skills.

Some have been evicted from their homes, lost their cars, and not been able to buy essential things like food. 
As for me, I lost my card and requested a replacement card. Since this system outage, I have not been able to access the {$140.00} that was in there when I still had the old card. Since I could access the funds for myself, I decided to just pay the {$140.00} through their bill pay feature to my landlord. I have used their bill pay service in the past to pay my rent and electricity bill. I sent this money to my landlord on the XXXX. She usually receives the money within a week. I called her yesterday ( the XXXX ) and she told me she had not received a check in the mail. I fear that even though it said it was sent on the XXXX it was, in fact, not. My direct deposit from social security was loaded on the XXXX. It is still in my account BUT I can not access it because I can not activate or set a pin for my new card. I have called XXXX different numbers to set my pin on the automated system only to be transferred to a live customer service representative. They would transfer me to a supervisor, or another number where I could supposedly activate my card. I was either put on hold with no one answering or directed to an automated system that asked me to enter my social security number and the system would say "" Sorry I did not get that '' when I entered my SS #. I have been without money since this transition/outage occurred. It has been THREE WEEKS that have passed where I and others have not been able to use their card but it was "" blocked '' or "" pending activation '' ( which is what my account says on the webpage. I have been going to the food bank during this time with my social worker to get food. I have been without basic necessities such as toilet paper, food for my cats, etc. My main concern is being able to pay my rent and utilities and recovering the {$140.00} that I do not believe was sent to my landlord. As soon as I can recover my funds completely I am switching to a credit union. Naturally this whole situation has caused me stress, anxiety and anger. I can not conceive of a system change that takes 3 WEEKS to work properly. This is completely unacceptable and the worst customer service imaginable.XXXX has stated that he is setting up a "" XXXX dollar '' fund to reimburse those that have incurred late fees or any other damages but he stated also you had to submit proof of this. 
I beg of anyone to help me get my card activated and a pin set up so I can withdraw my funds and pay my bills so my situation does not get serious with eviction or being severely behind on my bills. I will not allow myself to be in such a situation! My solution to all this is very simple. Let me withdraw my money so I can leave rushcard and get on with my life!!

She checked the account and confirmed that I was correct. She stated that she would put in a request for corrections to be made. After 3 days the balance was still the same so I tried calling again. The XXXX representative confirmed that I had called in before and that there was indeed a problem with the account. She told me to hold for a supervisor. The supervisor stated that she would expedite the request for correction. Today is XXXX XXXX, 2015 and it still as not been corrected. I made my last call today about an hour ago. I was told that the balances on the computer and the ones that were being given by the automated telephone service were incorrect and that to obtain a correct balance I needed to go to an ATM. Well, that did n't work either. My amount that is missing from my account is small, but when you are on a budget you need every cent. I have since had my direct deposit stopped, but I would like to have my balance corrected and the remaining funds made available to me.

I transitioned my direct deposit back to my bank account, and over the course of a month or two drew down reliance on Bluebird for financial services. 

Over a month ago I called Bluebird to request that they close my account. I was harassed to provide a reason, and I repeatedly requested not to. I was then hung up on for cursing at them for not doing as I had politely instructed. Attempts to contact American Express Corporate Customer Service were in vain, their corporate headquarters switchboard repeatedly terminated my calls, and finally redirected me back to customer service. 

Finally, I was told that they would close my account. They requested a call back in 24 hours to confirm. I told them I considered that conversation and confirmation that they would close my account final notice, no additional conversation was required and that I would not call back in 24 hours to confirm closure of my account. 

I did receive a check for the remaining account balance within 7-10 business days as they said. However, I have repeatedly received monthly statements for the past 2 months for an account that was supposed to be closed and that I was harassed during my attempts to close said account. 

American Express has played a dangerous game in choosing to aggressively attempt to retain clients, harass them when they request to discontinue their relationship and then maintain accounts open months after requests for closure have been made. 

Please consider this final written notice of my DEMAND that this account be closed as well as the final explanation of facts in regard to this matter. At this time, I will not communicate in any other form that writing with American Express and do not wish to be contacted by them either directly through telephone calls or indirectly through their regularly scheduled spam and credit card offer mailers. They have clearly shown themselves to be inept at providing financial services as well as attending to the needs and preferences of their clients. 

Any attempts to ignore or neglect this will be treated as an indication of American Express ' lack of respect for my preferences and financial/credit history integrity and appropriate formal complaints will additionally be filed with the XXXX and credit reporting agencies.

03/15/2016,Prepaid card,Government benefit payment card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,,"I have a prepaid debit card issued by US bank as a vehicle to receive child support payments from the State XXXX. Recently US bank instituted a policy that changes the requested authorization holds at gas stations from the requested {$1.00} 3 day hold to a {$75.00} 10 day hold. The reality is that most merchants batch their credit card transactions daily, authorization holds should not last more than the requested 3 days. I recently visited a gas station to purchase gasoline with my US Bank issued prepaid card, and there was an issue with the pump which caused the transaction to time out without allowing me to purchase gas. I tried a second time and was only allowed to purchase {$9.00} of gasoline, although I had {$84.00} available before I began trying to purchase gas. Confused about what was happening, I contacted US Bank on the phone number on the back of my card. I was greeted by a representative that informed me that it is the policy of US bank to place a {$75.00} hold on child support funds issued on my card for 10 days anytime I purchase gasoline with the card. I informed the representative that I was not able to complete the first purchase as the machine had timed out so no purchase actually occurred. I asked her what I needed to do to get the {$75.00} authorization released so I could purchase groceries with the remaining funds as I planned to do. She casually told me that it was impossible to have the inaccurate {$75.00} hold released that was placed in error with the gas pump timed out and that I needed to wait 10 day for US bank to release the funds back to me to be used for the purpose intended ( child support ). I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was transferred to a person who identified herself as XXXX XXXX. She casually and callously told me that I should have read my disclosures and that even though a gas purchase did n't actually happen, since I entered my card into the gas station pump, I am subject to the {$75.00} hold for 10 days. I explained to her that the gas pump had an error and did n't provide me with gas, so purchase was actually completed, and I was told that was my problem and that it was impossible for the hold to be removed by US Bank. I find it incredibly concerning that a company as reputable as US Bank would make a decision to do this to people who depend on these child support funds to care for their children. First of all a {$75.00} hold is excessive in the first place, and for many families like mine, that is the amount of money spent buying groceries for a week. A purchase of gasoline, which cost less that {$25.00} should not warrant a {$75.00} hold. Secondly a hold of any amount for a period of 10 days is incredibly excessive. When errors like this occur, US bank is taking food from the mouths of children for almost 2 weeks due to a computer error that cardholders did not cause. It is already unfair enough that a financial institution, is allowed to hold these funds and not be required to pay interest but to not be held to the same rules as bank accounts, which are required to release holds within a reasonable amount of time, is simply unconscionable. This needs to be investigated as it is absolutely unfair to card holders. I did not cause the error at the gas pump and I am being punished as a card holder by US Bank for this problem. Not being able to purchase groceries for 10 days is simply unfair. US Bank should be held accountable and made to revisit this policy that renders card holders helpless in these situations, with excessive hold amounts for excessive time frames.

And proof of residence, I sent that in by email on XX/XX/2016. Now every time i call them it 's something new. First it was 3-5 than 10-14 days now 60 days before I hear something back. It just does n't make sense. I think it 's fraud. I do n't know if their trying to keep money or what. They wo n't tell me anything. So am lost here.I called XXXX a few days ago and they told me that everything on their end was good but they did find out that my money was used at a collection agency on XX/XX/2016 the next day after a bought it. But how is that so. I want to know because i registered it on XX/XX/2016 on their website and it said i was good to go. They said that the card was activated so i did n't need to go on line and register it. Now am really confused here they also said they do n't know why my vanilla prepaid visa is giving me such a hard time with this dispute. Its crazy how XXXX found out and was able to tell me that XXXX the incomm people from my vanilla act like they do n't know what 's going on with my dispute with them..PLEASE HELP ME SORT THIS OUT.

05/07/2015,Prepaid card,Mobile wallet,Fraud or scam,,"I used the services of Reloadit.com which is a funds loading service for certain brands of prepaid debit cards. I have used the service successfully in the past. 

About two months ago I attempted to load funds to a prepaid debit card but I was unable to do so. I received an error message after every attempt, so I contacted Reloadit customer service. They forwarded my request for assistance to the IT department, who contacted me several days later after. 

Reloadit sells scratch off cards containing XXXX digit pin numbers at various retail stores across the country. The pin numbers can be redeemed at www.reloadit.com and turned into digital funds that can be loaded onto prepaid debit cards. Reloadit.com provides users with their own online account which serves as a go-between, or a "" safe '' in which users can store their pin codes until they want to load them onto a prepaid debit card. There is a waiting period of XXXX hours after the time of purchase before users can add any funds to their prepaid debit cards. During this time however, users can keep the funds in their reloadit.com safe. 

This is where my issue begins. I left XXXX pin codes in my safe worth {$500.00} each prior to attempting to load them to a prepaid debit card. I received an error message when attempting to add my funds to the prepaid cards. This is when I contacted customer service about my issue. 

Overall, customer service and the IT department proved to be very unhelpful. The IT rep named XXXX told me that I needed to email photos of the Reloadit scratch offs and their receipts. I did so promptly. I was then told that my pictures were not good enough and I needed to resend them. I did so promptly. Then I was told that I needed to take pictures on different backgrounds. I told XXXX this was not possible since I no longer had the physical receipts and scratch offs. The pictures I sent him had been taken prior to me contacting customer service, as I took pictures of the receipts and scratch offs just in case I did misplace them. He then instructs me that I should travel XXXX hours away back to the store at which I bought the Reloadit scratch offs and request that the store dig through their system to find another copy of my receipt. I informed XXXX that I would not be doing that and he needed to offer me an alternative to getting my money back. He then told me that he could not help me unless I could retrieve the original receipts and take pictures of them on the different backgrounds. 

I feel that XXXX was very unhelpful and ultimately would keep finding excuses as to why he and his company would not refund me my money. At this point I was very upset and disheartened with the whole situation. What baffles me more than anything is that no one has explained to my why my funds are being held. The reason could be completely erroneous and an ultimate attempt to discourage users from asking for their money back. I have cooperated with Reloadit and XXXX to a reasonable extent but we are past the point of reason. Their requests are becoming ridiculous considering that all I am asking for is my own money, not a gift or a handout.

I opened the credit dispute with American Express eventually providing them with the Customer Support attempts at contact I had with XXXX and a Screen shot of my account from XXXX. This screen shot showed that I could not check my messages as my paid subscription was not recognized and for which American Express had record of withdrawal from my account for the transaction. I then called several separate divisions of American Express Customer Service and told them that was all the information that I had and that they could either be diligent & vigilant in attending to this matter and getting me my money that I was defrauded back or not. I was also told that I could not further escalate my concerns when multiple managers in their Customer Service divisions lied and told me they could not put me in contact with the corporate office. I then found their corporate office number online and called the following day. 

I received a call back and explained the issue and again stipulated that American Express should follow through on my legitimate transaction dispute and resolve the matter in a timely fashion. I received a call back a few days subsequent to that call from another person in their corporate office. I missed this call due to work and when I called back I left a voicemail explaining my reason for calling and requesting callback. Yesterday marked a full calendar week and several business days between their last call back and my last request for a call back. I left a voicemail largely stipulating the same information as my XXXX voicemail and this has not been returned.

I put in the necessary information ( SSN, birthdate, full name, etc, ). Once I completed this process and put the inactive card number in, I received and error message and was instructed to call the company. I did not see anything strange with this as I have had my identity stolen before. I called and attempted to complete the process over the phone and was directed immediately after entering my number to a customer service agent ( which I use this term very loosely as you will soon realize ) and was first informed about a previous charge on my card from five years ago that resulted in a negative balance of {$XXXX}. I was then told that until I cleared this debt, I could not activate my card. My only other options were to of course let them take the funds "" owed '', or to get a refund on my purchase and wait 20 days for it to come in the mail. In addition to that I would be charged a fee for them to do this. In retrospect I did not react well to this news. I became quite the person to deal with and I ended up hanging up the phone because I was so frustrated. After I had calmed down just a bit, I called them to try to find out about their policies and where it stated that they were allowed to do this. I still have not gotten the answer to that. I was then told by a representative, that I would need to submit my ID, SSN, and proof of residency. I have done this countless times from this past Friday until now, but they keep saying different things like I did not receive a reference number, my copies were incomplete. Today I have scanned the documents in versus taking a photo from my phone, so hopefully this annoyance will cease. As for them taking my money, I have researched and researched. From what I have gathered, they can not legally do this, especially since they made no attempts to collect said debt from XX/XX/XXXX. Their response is that they treat me like any bank would when there is a balanced owed. My response was that a bank would attempt to collect said debt, through email, snail mail, or phone call. It is even more frustrating since I have told them they may collect said debt, and they still refuse to activate my card. I have repeatedly told them that I would no longer be bothered with their company or their services once this has been done. Why can I not have access to my own funds?

I called that number and was promptly disconnected after a recorded message that they were too busy to take the call. 

I called the regular American Express customer service number. They could not help with the PASS card cancelation but they attempted to use an internal direct line to connect me to the PASS card dept. I was left on hold for 60 minutes before I ended the call. 

I attempted to access the PASS account through my XXXX XXXX on line account access, but was given a message that my PASS card access was unavailable and that I should call XXXX. 

XXXX additional calls to American Express customer service failed to gain access to cancel the PASS cards, despite XXXX minute waits each time.

I asked American Express customer service to pass me up to a supervisory/senior level customer service representative, but was refused. 

I am stuck in an endless loop and unable to contact PASS to ensure that cards are cancelled, any remaining balances refunded, and avoid pending fees. Subsequent calls to the posted toll free number for PASS customer service result in the same recorded message and an immediate disconnect.

I requested to talk to a supervisor, named XXXX, and he said they needed to try again, and I should receive in XXXX hours. XXXX also said if still not working, they would expedite a physical cardOn XX/XX/XXXX, I had to call again because I still received nothing. I talked to another supervisor, XXXX. She said to she would n't send a physical card and needed to try a different email address. I gave a different email, and was told that I should receive in XXXX hours. By the way, all my email IDs are working fine receiving all legit emails, including those emails from Amex on other business. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had to call again, I talked to agent XXXX, and he told me that XXXX hours waiting was not enough, needed to wait for XXXX hours then call backOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called again. Another agent XXXX told me they could not issue a physical card. But he sent an email to their Concerns team for approval of physical card, and I needed to call back in 3-5 business days to see if Concerns department would approve the physical card. also XXXX agreed to ask XXXX to give me a call back in an hour, but no one ever called me back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again. Got to connect to the supervisor XXXX, he did n't seem to remember anything about this and he was still asking me if I preferred ecard or physical card, and I had to explain the ecard not working and the whole history. Then he checked with their Concerns department. After I was put on hold for XXXX minutes, he still insisted they could only do an ecard, and what to do the same thing as they did and failed for XXXX times already, even wanted to ask me for yet another email address. I then told him that he was just trying to get me dealt with without resolving the issue and I would definitely make the whole experiences known to others if they didb't resolve it in a satisfactory way. Then he put me on hold and then told me he would escalate me to the Concern department to issue a physical card. When I questioned him what about the outcome of last time they sent my case to the Concerns department, he just dodged my question and put me on hold again. Then came back and told me that he saw the last escalation to Concerns department, but they had not responded, and he just re-escalated again. He also confirmed my mailing address again where the card should be sent. He asked me to wait for XXXX business days to receive the physical card. 

It has since been a month, and I never received any physical or ecard, no one at American Express attempted to contact me at all. I have no way to access my remaining balance on my egift card. Now I believe no one at American Express has the true interest to solve the problem for me and let me to use my money. 

I am not sure if CFPB can help me, but I believe I need to make the extremely poor customer experiences known to other consumers and to American Express. To say the least I will NOT use any American Express for my gift card needs for a long long time.

My direct deposit is also scheduled to hit today and when I tried canceling it with my company it was too late, so now all of my pay check is in this account, in which I do n't even know if this *** company is still in business. XXXX XXXX some of us need our money, unlike yourself. I also agree with the last persons review. Your call center reps all need to speak clear English. 

I called the company number and literally fell asleep. Woke up 2 hours later, and I was still on hold with the hold music. As of today XXXX XXXX. I have finally received my direct deposit, but not all my money that was originally in the account. It 's to much trying to get thru, it was n't a whole lot, so once my direct deposit kicked in I have now cancelled the card and service. This is the worst experience and I will never look back at this company. I do want compensation for the inconvenience and would love to be a part of a class action law suit, if one exists or start my own.

I was told 7 to 10 days. 2 weeks later still no replacement card. Then finally it came in the mail. I opened it to realize it was the same numbers just different expiration dates and different XXXX numbers on the back of the card. Didnt think anything of it. Well after calling for another 2 weeks i recieved my funds on my card XX/XX/2015. So the system told me my card was activated as well. One problem i had i couldnt remember the pin number so i called. Put my info in with new XXXX digit code on back and the operator told me wrong number. After a few times i tried my previous XXXX code from my first card and it still told me the same thing. So i got transfered to soneone i could speak to. Which shocked me. Few weeks prior i would have to select the feature of applying for a new card to talk to anyone live. So the gentleman told me i should have not gotten the same number when they replace card came in. I told him its not lost, no one has it. I had just damaged it accidently and i couldnt use it at all to swipe or to withdrawl. So didnt see how it would really make a difference. So, now once again he deactivated the card and sent me out a new one. Today is Wednesday and he told me it would be here Friday. I am wondering if this is the start of another two week checking my mail box to no card. Or better yet get charged for another replacement card that is sent quicker which costs more money. Someone has to pay for it. Either way I am back at square one with a XXXX Dodge Avenger that is about to be in a reporting for non payment which will effect my credit. I have been trying to play catch up for a month now and i am still struggling being a single mom with XXXX children who i dont get any support for. So, i dont just have that kind of money to throw away or wait for. When i got this prepaid card i didnt think their was ever going to be such a hassel. Boy was i wrong. Makes we want to stick to the local banks where i can actually go in and see and talk to someone when issues arise. 
I guess i am wondering what Rushcard is going to do to help me when my car payment goes over a 30 day late payment where my account will be considered delinquent. They report me to all three major credit bureos. Which i spent over a year paying an agency to help get my credit half way decent. Now, a gliche, update system, whatever Rushcard 's excuses were, once again in a diffrent aspect is back to square one. Please get this fixed and help me out so I can get my fiancial statements up to date and live my life stress free again. Never would imagine this would or even could happen until it has to me. 
Also a little helpful note. It would be a little stressfree to be able to speak to someone that understands me and well as i can understand them.

Although the representatives were unable to explain the suspension, in reading through section XXXX D of the Member Agreement, there is mention of potential fraudulent or inappropriate activity. Having only applied for the account hours ago and not receiving any card or account number, I have n't had the opportunity to even make use of the XXXX account, much less engage in any activity violating the Member XXXX.

This happened XX/XX/XXXX, On XX/XX/XXXX I called "" XXXX '' at American Express Prepaid : XXXX to complain because I had not opened the accounts. I ordered him to close the accounts because I had not opened them and they were illegitimate. He said the only way he could do that is if I gave him my social security number and date of birth. I told him I was not going to do that because the accounts are fraudulent and I am obviously being scammed with the threats of a {$4.00} monthly maintenance fee that their letters all announce that will be charged on each of my XXXX accounts. To avoid that their letters say I can drain the accounts using the ATM and by paying their fee. I suppose they would like me to put more money in the accounts and pay {$15.00} a month for their services but if I do that what is to stop them from manufacturing XXXX more cards and presenting them as mine to make it {$30.00} a month? 

Please note they have never sent me a statement on any of these accounts and they have never sent me a single credit card! My belief is that this is a scam perpetrated upon the public by American Express to scare the unwitting to do business with them by extracting fees. Because it has been going on for almost two years now and still causing me distress it is clearly a harassment of the public. Further, during the time these fraudulent accounts were opened my credit has been entirely frozen for the last 10 years! 
XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called the number again for prepaid cards and spoke with "" XXXX. '' XXXX said all of the things "" XXXX '' said including the {$4.00} monthly charges and I had to give him my social and birth date to cancel the cards. I requested and spoke to "" XXXX '' his supervisor, # XXXX. XXXX said had to have the social to cancel the cards and that the cards were legitimate and the charges would occur. All of this was being recorded. I explained that the cards were fraudulent and I was not going to give my vital information to an entity that I knew for a fact was trying to defraud and scam me and I flatly ordered her to cancel these accounts. She refused the same as XXXX and XXXX did before her. Only under direct questioning did she admit that when the funds were absorbed in the accounts the accounts would go on "" inactive status '' and charges would end. 

We conclude that this is a scam being perpetrated against the public by American Express because no one else possibly has anything to gain by their actions ; with XXXX cents thy make at least XXXX ATM fees just to get them off ones back. I know they were continuing to attempt to hook me because according to their XX/XX/XXXX letters those those maintenance fees were to have been charged on XX/XX/XXXX. That means that as of XX/XX/XXXX even the card with the massive XXXX cent balance would have been moved to inactive status. This is XX/XX/XXXX there is no excuse for them not telling me that there would be no more charges. The accts. are XXXX, XXXX, XXXX.

Here 's the problem. When I add money to my card via the free ACH route, the system tells me very clearly before I complete the transaction that the funds will be available in a few minutes. Once I 've completed the transaction, and check the status, it says the funds wo n't be available until a date 10 days in the future.

Now at this point, I 've had to pay somebody else to use my money. When I contact XXXX about it, they offer no help and their only solution is to use the debit card route ( which costs me money ). When I add the money via debit card, it comes out right away. But I 've already added money via ACH, which is going to come out on the next business day. So in this example, the money is taken out of my account TWICE, with a waiting period of up to 10 days to access the other half of it.

I did not attempt to load the cards into my account until XXXX XXXX, finding the funds of the first card had been removed. I immediately called the number on the back of the card ( InComm ) and scratched off the material to reveal the PIN while on the phone with their representative, to find the money removed as well. 

The cards have only ever been at my home and the XXXX XXXX sheriff 's office. I am the person who scratched the material off to reveal the PIN. I am a long time XXXX and XXXX user, technically savvy, with a degree XXXX. I work XXXX. I have a history of usage of these cards in my account to demonstrate my usage and knowledge about them. 

I am the victim of some type of fraud where it appears access was gained to my PIN. This could have been low tech ( tampering with the card ) to medium ( rogue employee at InComm with access to information ) to more sophisticated ( breach of InComm data. ) InComm 's position per XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) is that because the money was loaded to many accounts, that this is an indicator that I got scammed and gave someone my PIN, and that InComm is not liable for making me whole because of this. 

I agree that that activity is suspicious and indicative of fraud and money laundering techniques designed to make the money hard to track and retrieve. It is likely that the money is gone and that compromised accounts were used as first line recipients of the money. I believe tracking down the criminals is unlikely to result in recovery of money or finding the perpetrators and believe this to be a criminal matter whose responsibility for further investigation is InComm 's. 

Although this suspicious activity is indicative of fraud, it provides no indication as to how the PIN was obtained to access money, nor indicative of any fault of mine as a cardholder. Furthermore, credit cards have XXXX nightly batch as well as in now real time are able to hold transactions as suspicious behavior is encountered. If InComm has discovered a pattern of suspicious activity, they can implement similar measures to protect their cardholders. However they have been negligent in doing so. Their position on this matter is not based on data that supports it, but on it being a conclusion they want to reach because they do not perceive themselves to be liable if a cardholder provided a PIN. 

I loaded this money into the card with the expectation that it would be safe. InComm has been negligent in XXXX making me whole as well as making a real effort to protect cardholders, with a culture of blaming the victim rather than improving their product. This can be seen in other examples of similar products they sell as well as this particular product. XXXX XXXX CASE # : XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) I have been in contact with the company privately but thus far they have refused to provide any relief. I am the victim of fraud and an unauthorized financial transfer from my account due to InComm 's negligence in both preventing and resolving fraud. 

Furthermore, I also believe this error resolution to be in violation of Regulation E - Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Per Subpart A, V. Consumer Liability and Error Resolution ( XXXX CFR XXXX, XXXX ) I believe InComm is in non-compliance with the federal regulation and has not attempted to follow any error resolution procedures.

04/26/2015,Prepaid card,General purpose card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,,"First Note : This is NOT a duplicate issue. The other issue reported was regarding a transaction in XXXX of last year. This is a NEW case with a NEW issue. Both cases involve the same card issuer, but different transactions and cards are involved. 

XXXX/XXXX/15 - Purchased a gift card for {$500.00}. The receipt indicated no problems loading / activating the card -- said APPROVED on the receipt. 

After opening noticed that the card inside the package had been tampered with -- someone had destroyed the mag stripe and placed the tampered card on the shelf in a different store. 

I called the number on the back of the card and after entering the card number, was forwarded immediately to customer service. I was told by Customer Service that I would need to be sent a replacement card and that I needed to fax information to "" Lost / Stolen Card Replacement '' to get that process started. 

XXXX/XXXX/15 -- Collected the required information ( name, address, e-mail, phone number, card info and receipts ) and faxed it all off to the specified number for Lost / Stolen Card Replacement. Indicated that they could call me at ANY HOUR if necessary. 

XXXX/XXXX/15 -- After hearing nothing, called and asked for status. They could n't find in system. Opened an inquiry to escalate. Faxed the information off to them again and realized that I had transposed XXXX numbers when I typed them. XXXX was XXXX. 

Immediately called them back and inquired with the correct card number. They indicated that A REPLACEMENT CARD HAD BEEN SENT THE PREVIOUS DAY ( XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). 

XXXX/XXXX/15 - Still had not seen a replacement card in the mail, so called the number on the back of the Gift Card. Found that the previously locked/inactive card was now active and that the {$500.00} loaded on the card was now roughly {$11.00}. Immediately hit XXXX to get Customer Service. 

They told me that since they did n't see any fraudulent activity on my tampered card YET, they had simply activated the card on XXXX and that NO REPLACEMENT CARD HAD BEEN SENT. ( Apparently the person I had talked to on XXXX had lied to me about a replacement card being in the mail on XXXX. ) I WAS NEVER CONTACTED AFTER THE ORIGINAL CARD WAS ACTIVATED AND THE SCAMMERS WHO TAMPERED WITH THE CARD IN THE FIRST PLACE APPARENTLY DRAINED THE ENTIRE CARD. 

The CSRs on the phone insisted that I need to dispute the fraudulent charges and go through the standard dispute process. I have been through this process before and US Bank XXXX XXXX in their handling of these cases. The entire process takes about 3 MONTHS to complete. 

Before the call ended, the CSR I spoke with handed me off to an escalation agent, and that escalation agent indicate that an escalation manager would call me back within XXXX hours. I have not yet received a call from them six days later.

The mention on the letter that they do not accept printed checks, they do not accept deposits via wire transfers, if you do they will return the check to you or destroy it.

I purchased a {$500.00} XXXX Gift Card from XXXX 's that was issued by US Bank. The moment I opened it up, I realized something was wrong with the packaging. I tried to use it and was not able to. I realized the card was already compromised, so I called US Bank ( card issuer ) immediately to shut down the card.

I faxed in the paperwork a ( XXXX ) few days later for the card replacement. Fast forward to today XXXX/XXXX/15. I called in to check on the status of the card replacement, I received a response from them saying they could not replace the card because funds were used. Now how did this happen on a shut down card is beyond me. Either the rep lied to me and told me she did shut it down on the spot, or she never did it to begin with. Either way, both scenarios demonstrate the incompetency levels of US Bank service reps. Now, instead of waiting for a card replacement, I now have to file a fraud report because the genius of a US Bank service rep did not do her job. Also, this genius rep did not put in any notes on the account either, so when other reps looked at the account, they saw nothing of the shutdown ( or so I 'm told ). I 'm expecting this to take another XXXX months to get resolved ( if at all ) courtesy of incompetent service reps.

10/25/2015,Prepaid card,ID prepaid card,"Managing, opening, or closing account",,"Open tickets XXXX ) I am sending this letter today to express my complete sadness and discomfort with your services. As with all things there will be times when issues arise and even in ones efforts to resolve them effectively and sufficiently, there will be failures ; however in the case of this technical revamp Rush has proven to be incompetent. 
IT implementation is not my area of expertise however in my opinion a little more strategic planning may have been in the best interest of the customer, as well as the company 's brand ; which is now being viewed as negative. I assume one would have created a few mock situations, running them completely through, as a proactive approach and a way to resolve root causes in a timely manner. 
Please understand I have been a customer with Rush since it launched, give or take a year. Although the card is not the best of them currently in the market, I have prided myself on being involved in what appeared to be a company that believed in the underbanked and had the backing of XXXX XXXX, who outside of rush I respect. Rush vision was to provide financial power to those who are/were underbanked, have the desire to establish credit or rebuild credit, among other things. 
In addition to this I have even recommended family and friends who really had no desire to have a Rush card get one, as this allowed us to transfer money from one card to another for XXXX versus using XXXX XXXX or XXXX = Financial power/flexibility. By the way this service is no longer working ; which means there is no need for them or even myself to stay with Rush. Understand, I am very loyal and despite me being able to use a normal bank I enjoy the transfer to transfer card feature and would much rather not jump ship. 
To date the changes made within the customer service department and its procedures I have embraced ; however I am at wits end. With all due respect, I am a person that believes in empowering people from all walks of life, but considering one is in a financial bind due to rush, having a person with a language barrier answering questions with lack of knowledge is extremely frustrating. In my opinion despite ones background we all deserve equal opportunity however Rush has not provided their workers with the adequate tools to successfully address the current needs. 
Instead customer service places you on hold for over XXXX mins, then the phone lines disconnect. Please see below example A. of just one of my many calls to Rush, where I was on hold for a long time and then line disconnected. 
Also to add assault to injury on my part, I either lost my wallet or it was stolen, needless to say, as normal immediately I contacted Rush by phone and email to freeze, or deactivate the card, and to no avail, due to the IT issues. 
Below is a chain of events about this communication, and by the way the card is still active, and still in risk of someone using it unauthorized. 
At this point, I do not know what to do because my direct deposit is being issued to this active, but lost card. I have since contacted my HR department who is trying to stop the transaction and issue a live check ; which puts me in further issues, as I will be out of state on payday and will not have any funds or ways to cash the check. My desire was to have the lost/stolen card cancelled and a new one expedited to me over night ; however in not being able to speak to anyone at Rush, this is not feasible again. 
As you can see Rush team, what should have been a simple IT enhancement, has turned into a financial Amputation, for those of us who believe in you. I have had to use XXXX XXXX to secure funds for my rent, I have had to pay things online with a card I do not have with the hopes whoever finds it does n't use it.

However, now, 2 weeks later, a lot of cardholders ' accounts are still unavailable and people are unable to access their account ( some reporting that RushCard is unable to even locate their account ), others reporting that they had funds in their account and now the funds are missing or gone and RushCard has no idea where they went to. I personally was not affected for any type of direct deposit or card-to-card transfer or anything of the sort, but I DID have funds and felt unsafe at loading my card for fear of not being able to acccess the funds. I am reporting the aforementioned entities as fraudulent ( not a scam ; I 've been a loyal customer since 2009 and nothing like this has ever happened ) in the way they handle business. Some cardholders are even reporting that customer service representatives are even taunting them, claiming they got their funds on their cards from RushCard, yet people who are working and things have n't. It 's quite disheartening. Some are reporting that RushCard ca n't even locate their accounts, as if they were never a customer to begin with. Some say they call and are on the line for quite an extended period of time, while others are simply hung up on and have to call back, making them feel hopeless. Some have to go to other banks to take out loans, others going to payday loan places so they can pay bills and provide food for themselves and/or their loved ones, gas for getting to and from work, etc. XXXX cardholder claimed she received a phone call from RushCard stating they are "" investigating accounts XXXX by XXXX '' and she will have to wait to get any of her stolen money back. She asked the RushCard customer support representative "" how do I eat in the mean time '' and the rep said suggested her "" local church or soup kitchen. "" I have no idea what the majority of these cardholders are facing and it sickens and disgusts me that RushCard would do this and say things of this nature to cardholders, working-class people and people who receive a monthly check, some still waiting for it to deposit.

When I telephoned XXXX XXXX, I was told that I could wire the money ( volkswagon has its own account with XXXX XXXX ). I was told that I could wire the money by XXXX of XXXX methods : telephone, online or go into a local office to do so. I was also quoted the fees for each of the methods. 

Because of a pulled XXXX I elected the telephone method and that would include a {$27.00} fee. After all of my information had been collected the agent ( XXXX ) informed me that he could not get the wire to go through. When I asked him to explain, he stated that I needed to get Volkswagon on the line - ( I did while he was holding. ) Volkswagon explained that they had no problems in the pass using their account with clients. I explained this to the agent. He stated that perhaps I should try again in 24 hours. I asked why? What would be the difference? Frustrated, I asked to speak with his supervisor ( XXXX ). 

When XXXX, ( supervisor ) talked with me he explained that I needed to go into a local branch to wire the money. I told him that his advertisement states that money may be wired by phone, online or at a local branch. He stated that I needed to be "" validated '' and perhaps if I went into a local branch, they could see that I had tried to send the money earlier and would oblige me. This, I explained should be 'foretold ' to your customers and the Nation-at-large. If you can not send money via phone, and have to go into a local branch, then your disclosure or advertising which is currently "" false '' advertising should be changed to have the consumer go to your website to read "" Terms and Agreements '' before trying to wire money or at least instruct agents to forewarn the client that the transfer may not go through because of "" validation '' issues. Actually, it will not go through! 

This is incongruent with media advertisements from XXXX XXXX ... '' telephone, '' "" online, '' or "" local branch. '' I then terminated the call after telling him that I would try to transfer the money via online. He did not tell me that it would not work either. Therefore, I tried to use the online account registration that the first agent ( XXXX ) had set up for me. However, after dealing with a technical representative, trying over XXXX times, times to register, he apologized and gave me a 50 % discount to go into a local branch! Needless I believe my name and issue was already being circulated by XXXX, not to allow the transaction to go through the system. 

Therefore, would you please ( so that other consumers do n't have to encounter the 2-hour defeated efforts such as I ) have inform XXXX XXXX change their advertisement to state that money may not be wired by phone or online - that one will have to be validated through a local branch. That kind of information would have saved me two hours of frustration. Believe me, I understand that our nation has great fraud and security issues. I only ask that legal advertising ; informing consumers takes place in order to realize that all entities are adhering to the policies and systems such as your credible organization in order to make them work. 

Thank you for your valuable time in this matter. I hope that XXXX XXXX will change it methods for allowing consumers to transact business with them by being honest and up-front with the consumers. This if a form of "" false advertising. '' The 50 % discount was a "" pay-off '' to remain silent after I had informed them that I would be contacting you - not just for my benefit but also as advocate for others!

On XXXX I used my Serve Prepaid cards to purchase airline tickets for myself and my family for an XXXX trip.

Of all the tickets, my refund in the amount of {$2500.00} did not process properly ( this was Airline 's error ) and had to be reprocessed in XX/XX/XXXX. This time the refund was properly back to my Serve prepaid card but for some reason the Serve Prepaid system flagged the refund as suspicious and/or against their terms and conditions. Within a matter of 48 hours my wife 's and my Serve prepaid accounts along with the several authorized user cards were closed. I also received an email stating that the refund for the airline ticket was denied and sent back to to the Airline. 

When I called Serve, I explained that the originalrefund was in fact legitimate and originated from a transaction several months prior.

I paid for the gift card with my Wells Fargo Visa charge card. My card was charged for the purchase on or around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells to inquire about the card, as I had not received it. I was having it mailed to me, rather than my son, to include it with other gifts for his birthday. I was told to give it another week.

He got a recording that said "" thank you, this card has been cancelled ''. Turns out.. the initial card I had ordered did arrive and that is the card that I mailed to him ... the replacement card never arrived ... 

As a result, I went to XXXX XXXX and wired my son the {$150.00} cash as a replacement for the intended gift card. 

I then cancelled the XXXX gift card, which still had not arrived .... and never did arrive.

I was speaking to a supervisor named XXXX. He said that he completely understood, would reissue the refund, waive the {$15.00} cancellation fee, issue in my name, as I was the purchaser, and mail it to me.

XXXX although incomm 's response to the prior complaint notes they have 'conclusively ' determined i 'm a participant in victim assisted fraud, and opined that i have not provided any substantiating evidence of my claims, i now provide it in my blog. 

the video contains me telling the viewer what a PIN # will be, then scratching off a card to reveal it. this PIN # has never been communicated out by incomm. if that is the case, how was i able to do it? i also provide video and photos of the person who loaded my funds living in atlanta ( incomm headquarters ) and being friends with a former XXXX living in XXXX, the role of a person who would oversee a database and have the greatest ability to compromise sensitive data in it. however in this case, it was not protected at all, so anyone in the company can get to it.

2. per my inside contact, the PIN numbers are stored in plaintext in the database, available to all in incomm IT. i provided this person my XXXX digit numbers, and they told me all of the secure PINs. the last XXXX of my PINs are in my XXXX and CFPB complaints - but XXXX never made these formal complaints. i set up a meeting between XXXX and skeet 's team. skeet 's team has never communicated these PIN numbers out for XXXX cards. yet i have all of them. there are more that remain, should incomm like to see how the reveal in my video plays out in a court of law. 

3. the division under skeet is either 100 % incompetent or 100 % obstructionist. the same model they use to determine i was a participant in victim assisted fraud claimed XXXX was as well - but with his PINs not scratched off, this is impossible ( which incomm did admit. ) this however has not caused incomm to stop using their broken model. despite XXXX 's case, and despite the how and who of the theft that occurred to me being reported XXXX/XXXX/16 to skeet and XXXX XXXX, i was given absolutely no restitution. i was still victim blamed as if a participant in victim assisted fraud. 

under threat of a lawsuit in federal court a settlement has been offered, which i took. however this does not fix the problem nor has it made past victims whole. this database has likely been designed this way for years, and incomm has very likely screwed over many victims along the way who did not have the time, skill, and luck to determine the full scope of their negligence.",,"Incomm Holdings, Inc.",IL,600XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/19/2016,Closed with explanation,No,Yes,1927920

06/10/2016,Prepaid card,Gift or merchant card,Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,,"This complaint refers to CFPB complaint XXXX in which I first brought unauthorized charges to the attention of InComm and found no resolution. It also builds on complaint XXXX in which I point out fundamental flaws to which Skeet Rolling of InComm/ITCFL offered no rebuke for and just dismissed offhand. I expect subsequent consumer protection to be taken as a result of my complaints and will be following up with the CFPB Ombudsman as well. My unaddressed complaints are as follows : 1. InComm is using a model for determining Victim Assisted Fraud ( VAF ) which knowingly produces false positives, because it allows them to attempt to deny liability for claims against their negligent actions in protecting consumer funds. This is no more clear than in the case of XXXX XXXX, who was identified as a participant in VAF, who met personally with XXXX fraud investigation team and found his cards had not been tampered with nor had his cards had their secure PIN # revealed. The model has obvious logical flaws as a result of this, however is still used and applied in other cases ( such as my own. ) InComm has failed to identify what information caused them to "" conclusively '' identify myself as a participant in VAF, information and logic that will have a 0 % chance of holding up to actual scrutiny. 

2. Secure PIN numbers are currently stored in a fatally poor security design for the XXXX XXXX XXXX product ; they are ( a ) unencrypted and ( b ) viewable by many employees. There is no reason for either of these things, but correcting at least XXXX of them would make the product a lot more secure. Proof of this claim can be seen here : XXXX : XXXX? XXXX - in this video I tell you what the PIN # will be, then scratch off silvering to reveal the secure PIN. This has never been communicated out by Skeet or anyone on his team. If XXXX claim is that this claim has no merit, how is he able to explain that I reveal the PIN #? Also shown are internal serial numbers, how did I get them? Why is there no specific response to this point? 

XXXX. Not only have I identified how employees steal above, I have identified the employee that stole my money. Per CFPB complaint XXXX the XXXX account with the email address associated to "" gton '' was identified as VAF. The full address for the account my money was loaded to is XXXXXXXXXXXX. This is associated with this babysitting profile in XXXX ( where InComm hq is located ) XXXX XXXX # bio-more - which is also this woman on linkedin XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX? XXXX where she is friends with XXXX XXXX on XXXX : XXXX who XXXX XXXX XXXX was a former XXXX ( database superuser account - not that it required a superuser with their lack of protection ) at InComm. 

So what really happened? It 's rather obvious to anyone but InComm, who was provided all this information in XXXX ; XXXX XXXX stole my PINs and my money internally, then loaded it to accounts he and friends controlled.

Saturday XXXX XXXX, XXXX at approx. XXXX - I went to XXXX which is a local home store located in XXXX , Ohio . I went to purchase a couple of items with my XXXX Gift Card from XXXX. During checkout I was asked to swipe my gift card so the amount could be credited to my purchase. I was told that the card was declined. Since the card was not used and XXXX told me there were funds available, I was not sure why the card would not work. The cashier asked me to try again and run it as a credit card. I did. Again it was declined. The cashier asked me to run it one more time. I did and this time ran it as a debit card and entered a pin number that is on the back of the card. It was declined. The At Home store then informed me that there point of sale system would not allow the card to be swiped again and that three times was the limit. I was not able to purchase the items that I had picked out to use the gift card on. 
Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX - I looked at the back of my gift card and went to the website they suggest for card balance inquiries. I went to the site ( Exhibit A ) and entered my card number, the XXXX digit security code from the back and entered the robot code from the website. I hit Log In and the page refreshed removing all of the data I just entered. The page did not load or continue to a new page. The site looked to be broke. 
I then called XXXX at XXXX to determine the issue. The automated system asked me to enter my card number to make the process quicker. A customer service woman then took my call. The woman that I talked to asked me for the number on my card again. I provided the number and then she asked me what the value of the card was. I told her {$75.00}. She then proceeded to tell me that I was correct and that amount was still on the card. She told me that the card was purchased in XXXX XXXX ( this is after when I received the card ). I told her that the card was declined at a local store and she apologized for the inconvenience. She then proceeded to tell me that I would need to provide proof of purchase to them. I told her that this was a gift and that I did not purchase this card. 
I told her that I did not understand why they needed a proof of purchase when I have the card in my possession and there is still money on the card. It did not make sense. She explained that this was their process. I also wanted to know if the card was purchase with cash, what then? She stated that there was "" nothing that they can do '' if there is no proof of purchase. I explained that this did not seem correct and thanked her for her time. The call ended.

However I 've been informed as of late by several employees of PayPal 's Customer Service Dept "" Not to trust PayPal 's App '' and "" Not to be reliant upon PayPal 's App, but rather on [ their ] website. '' This does not help the consumer, like myself, be informed quickly and conveniently of funds that are available. PayPal insisted that i did n't have the funds in my regular PayPal Balance to cover those XXXX transactions, but only {$3.00}, which was applied to the first transaction of {$13.00} bringing it to {$10.00}. As a result of this, PayPal the withdraws debited transactions from a connecting checking account, which all PayPal users must do to initially open a PayPal account. At that time there was n't enough funds within my checking account to cover said debts. Therefore PayPal 's requests for the funds were denied. unbeknownst to me and assuming PayPal already acquired these funds from my PayPal balance, since I noticed it was low. So therefore I made a cash deposit of {$46.00} on on XXXX/XXXX/16 and another cash deposit of {$50.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16.

My balance per the phone line was over XXXX $ the returned merchandise was XXXX $ and yet the denied my XXXX $ purchase. I began an absolutely infuriating attempt to discuss the situation with Customer Service and have spent hours upon hours trying to identify who "" handles '' the money flow for the XXXX XXXX Prepaid XXXX card. XXXX XXXX says it has nothing to do with the card. XXXX says they have nothing to do with the card. US Bank says they have nothing to do with the card. Customer Service says they only supply the card but do n't manage the money flow.

And in the end if you work at it long enough they finally offer to open a "" dispute '' escalation ticket on your behalf with an assurance that someone will call you right back, which then becomes Within 24 hours and then with in 72 hours. They also presented a moving target on the actual reason for the hold, first saying the specific company was blocked and then when I attempted to make a purchase at another lumber store, was told it was the type of retailer, so then I went to a bank and was denied and they said no, it was my card that was blocked.

My complaint/biggest concern is that this is not the banks money being advanced to me on credit, this is my money, placed on a prepaid card so that I can take advantage of electronic purchasing and manage my finances on line.

But in this case not only is customer service a sham, but they are placing holds on money that is n't even in play.

I told the customer service rep that we would give the card details only if she can assure a refund and the rep was very optimistic and made us believe that she can get the refund for us. If I were informed of any possible problem, I could have avoided disclosing the gift card details and we could have kept all the cards with our self. 

So, right after we gave the gift card information, they have limited my access to our account "" XXXXXXXXXXXX '' and all these days, I have been communicating with them and doing frequent follow-ups about the status of the gift cards. Every time I call the Playstore customer service, they would point me to the Google wallet team who blocked my account.

I am tired of contacting them again and again and I have wasted so much of my time in my life.

I opened XXXX card specifically to receive my benefits payments. On month 1 which was XXXX XXXX, I was paid XXXX, which is short by {$110.00} with which the Social Security Administration states my whole payment was released to Netspend and they somewhere along the lines Netspend have helped themselves to the difference in payment.

Netspend never released that payment as I called continuously, no one would help me. In fact, the customer service agents were literally laughing at the situation. In XXXX, there were approximately XXXX payments from The Social Security Administration were released. From what The Social Security Administration states, they were payments I had never received in the amounts of XXXX,XXXX,XXXX,XXXX, and XXXX. Those payments are all showing as XXXX dollars deposited to the card. Netspend is trying to make it appear as I received all I was supposed to. not by a long shot. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received my correct payment amount released to me on time. In XX/XX/XXXX, I no longer used the card. however, my dependents payments were applied to the card. I did call Netspend several times stating fraudulent transactions that I neither made or authorized. Their customer service is less than desirable. I then filed my tax returns for XX/XX/XXXX and I was given a Netspend card. This is card number of the only XXXX cards I ever had. Somehow, everything got merged onto XXXX card including my Social Security XXXX payments.

08/26/2016,Prepaid card,Other special purpose card,Fees,,"After successfully using rebates from merchants for years, I recently had the unfortunate experience of receiving several American Express prepaid reward cards as rebates. 

The company is at least misleading in understating that XXXX monthly service fees will be charged after 5 months from issue. There is no legitimate reason for a monthly fee. All notification of such fees is in minuscule print at page bottom or on the back of the card. It also says funds do not expire immediately after the monthly fee description. Why is that there other than to confuse or mislead consumers? 

I had cards of {$10.00}, {$15.00}, and {$50.00}. After trying to check balances, I learned the first XXXX cards were at {$0.00} and the latter was at {$44.00}. So I ultimately used ( received ) {$44.00} of {$75.00} in rebates because I was misled by the obvious expiration date on the cards ( 5 years from issuance ) and the "" hidden '' fees descriptor. 

After checking all the sources I could, it seems these rebates are considered "" free '' money and so there is no recourse that I can detect. 

I feel like AmEx mislead me from fully utilizing my rebates. Maybe it is free money for these unscrupulous banks, but not me. 

I do not believe banks should be allowed to deduct service fees on rebate cards. There is no justification for a passive fee. They are not managing the money. 

If they are deducting monthly service fees as if I had an account with them, then I should be notified as the fees are deducted just as if I were a bank customer. That is how they are treating these prepaid reward cards. 

People should be made aware that there are fees associated with rebate reward cards and these unscrupulous banks should be made accountable.",,Amex,CA,945XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/30/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2084163

I opened the package on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and checked the balance online at XXXX, to find XXXX charges were made on XXXX and XXXX. I contacted AmEx to dispute the charges, and though they asked me for a particular lot number on the package, they still maintained they ca n't dispute the charges as they have a blanket policy of treating all gift cards as cash. They advised me to report the card stolen and have it replaced by them via mail within 10 business days for the remaining balance. They also suggested I contact the merchants to dispute the XXXX charge that was still pending. The pending charge was reported to AmEx as a physically swiped transaction, which could n't be possible unless XXXX cards exist with the same credit card number. 

I am quite certain that, as a consumer end product, the lot number on the packaging, which does n't correspond to the account number, is a unique identifier and, therefore, bound to all transactions that are physical/swiped. They asked for that information, but it did not help with the fraudulent transactions. It was only used to confirm the physical package, though I 'm familiar enough with point of sale systems to be rather sure that information is somewhere within the mag stripe data of each transaction for their own quality control and protection as issuer. 

While I am being reissued the card for the remaining balance, I am not confident the replacement card wo n't be subject to the same lack of fraud protection. You can imagine how ridiculous it is to open a gift card package for a AmEx gift card for a very high amount, just to learn it 's already been used by someone else. That there was no card activation process was concerning, and I think that leaves the consumer open to fraud that ca n't be disputed, thus protecting AmEx 's interests at the expense of the consumer 's vulnerability.",,Amex,CA,900XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/14/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2109224
