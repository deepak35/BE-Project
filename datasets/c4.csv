03/25/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"In XXXX XX/XX/2013, XXXX, a no-contract gym in XXXX, NM, used my XXXX year old son 's signature to forge an EFT authorization on my checking account, of which I am the sole owner/signatory. XXXX XXXX lifted the account/routing number from a paper check that I wrote to them to cover one month 's membership fees for my son. This check clearly listed only myself as the the account holder, not my son. My son was under the impression that he was signing up for a membership, nothing else, and simply signed his name, "" here, here, and here '', as directed by the gym 's employee, while no parent/legal guardian was present. He left with the understanding that he was good to use the gym for XXXX month only, since that was what my check covered, and only ended up using the gym for that XXXX month so as not to owe another month 's membership fee. 
Subsequent to that membership application, XXXX XXXX made XXXX unauthorized monthly EFTs on my checking account, without ever seeking proper authorization from me, or providing me a copy of the authorization they were using with my son 's signature. In XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered the unauthorized EFTs while stopping another authorized EFT for my son 's college fund, and informed XXXX XXXX to cease and desist the unauthorized transfers and return the stolen funds forthwith. They stopped the EFTs, but refused to refund the unauthorized transfers. 
I submitted a claim with my bank for restitution of the unauthorized EFTs, but my claim was denied because the gym 's bank, US Bank, will not return the transfers without the permission of XXXX, the forger of the EFT authorization. At no point during these fraudulent EFTs, did either my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, or the gym 's bank, US Bank, verify that the EFT authorization contained the name or signature matching the checking account holder, namely myself. I should also mention that my son has a different last name than I do, which should 've made the bogus EFT authorization painfully obvious. 
I am currently in the process of submitting a complaint with the NM Attorney General for XXXX, but am still confounded as to how this bogus EFT authorization flew by XXXX banks for nearly 2 years without question. 
I have since learned that shady businesses, such as no-contract gyms, PREFER or REQUIRE payment via checking account EFTs since they KNOW the banks wo n't verify authorization, probably because the EFT Act holds them blameless for EFT fraud. Although I realize the originator of the forged EFT authorization is responsible for this financial crime, it would not be possible without the blind eyes the financial institutions employ during these transactions. Shady businesses prefer ACH EFTs on checking accounts rather than credit card transactions because they know it 's very difficult for consumers to get the banks to restore funds transferred without proper authorization. There needs to be some changes to the EFT Act to levy penalties on banks that transfer money out of accounts without proper authorization, instead of only requiring the account/routing information of a viable account, and worrying about authorization after the fact, or when they get caught.

04/06/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"I recently opened an account with PayPal. I purchased XXXX PayPal "" MyCash '' cards ( PPMC ) for {$500.00} each and loaded them to my account in anticipation of making a few purchases on Ebay, the parent company PayPal. PPMCs are sold at various retail establishments, and in my case, I not only was required to show identification when I purchased them, but I also kept all receipts related to such purchase. Via a website that is, upon belief, authorized and/or maintained by PayPal, I loaded the PPMCs to my PayPal account. Because of limitations imposed by PayPal of {$500.00} of loads per day XXXX and {$4000.00} per month ), the XXXX PPMCs I purchases were loaded to my PayPal account over two consecutive days. 
Approximately one day after the second PPMC load ( which was within the guidelines and rules established by PayPal ), I received an email from PayPal that my account was limited due to what was described as "" high risk '' activity and that PayPal would be freezing my $ 1K in deposited funds for 180 days in order to make sure there were sufficient funds to cover any payment reversals. 
I telephoned PayPal and spoke to a representative in its "" Account Limitations Department, '' and was told essentially the same thing that was related in the email. Although I explained, and the representative conceded, that there were no payments made ( and thus there could not be a basis for any payment reversal ), I was told PayPal would not change its position. I also offered to provide copies of my PPMC receipts and other supporting documentation to establish that my purchase of the XXXX subject PPMCs was bona fide, but this offer was rejected. 
PayPal 's actions are unjust, unfair and punitive in nature. While I recognize the need to have certain loss prevention policies in place, I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with a system that cites this as a justification for detaining a customer 's money but does not provide a route for appeal or other process that would enable a customer such as myself to refute the implication raised through clear and convincing documentation.

I have had this account for many years, and the way it always worked I had to wait for the bank to transfer the money into the Paypal account, it took between three and five days to complete my transfer of money, and if I did n't have the money in my paypal account I could not purchase anything with the account.

04/22/2015,Money transfers,International money transfer,Other service issues,,"When paying a XXXX invoice of XXXX, I wanted to determine if I would be charged in USD before I used my XXXX XXXX card, so as to avoid foreign transaction fees. Otherwise, I would use a different credit card that does not charge such fees. I called PayPal on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX Eastern Daylight Time and was repeatedly assured during a 14-minute phone call I would be charged in USD. I transacted the payment at XXXX EDT on that date. I was charged in XXXX, and XXXX XXXX added a foreign transaction fee of {$84.00}. When I called PayPal back on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX EDT, I spoke to supervisor XXXX, who informed me that the only action available is to ask the merchant to refund the money. After disputing the charge with XXXX XXXX ( to no avail because this disputed the charge with the merchant directly, which is not what I need ), I attempted to communicate with PayPal again about this issue. I spoke to another representative who told me he would open an investigation and listen to the phone call in question to confirm that the conversation in question did in fact include the assurance that I would be charged in USD. He told me I would hear back in a couple of days. I never heard back, and a week later called back, and another representative told me again that they would investigate the matter, and that they saw no evidence of such a request on my profile. Again, I never heard back. I called back again on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX EDT, and spoke to another representative for 15 minutes who was rather difficult and rude and stalled my request to speak to a supervisor. After I insisted to speak to a supervisor, I was put on hold for 30 minutes before hanging up and calling back at XXXX EDT, asking to speak to a supervisor immediately. I spoke to supervisor XXXX, who told me she would send a request to an office to have a payment credited to my account to offset the fee of {$84.00}, and to call back to check on the status of the request. I called back the next day, XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX EDT, and the response was that I would have to deal with this through XXXX XXXX, since it was a fee charged by XXXX XXXX. Of course, XXXX XXXX is in no way responsible for this issue - PayPal is, because PayPal gave me wrong information that resulted in my being charged the foreign transaction fee. After nearly a month of being forestalled and disrespected by PayPal in this matter, I decided to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Ultimately I wanted to send this money to my sons account with Paypal. Each day I checked the balance on my Paypal account which was {$0.00} until I checked on XXXX XXXX XXXX, when the balance showed as {$230.00}. So I initiated a transfer of these funds from my Paypal account to my sons paypal account. Later that day I happened to be on line looking at my XXXX XXXX Accounts and I noticed that the {$230.00} had been taken from my savings account but had also been taken from my checking account. I was upset because I had instructed the {$230.00} to only come out of my savings and did not know why the {$230.00} was also taken from my checking account. Luckily this {$230.00} coming out of my checking account without my knowledge could have resulted in an overdraw but did n't. When I called Paypal the representative told me that they took the XXXX {$230.00} because the original {$230.00} had n't actually cleared when I initiated the transfer to my son. I asked if the {$230.00} had n't yet cleared from my XXXX XXXX Account savings account, based on my transfer on XXXX XXXX, then why did Paypal show that I had a {$230.00} available balance. I also wanted to know how did Paypal then manage to get the second {$230.00} from my XXXX XXXX Checking on the same day, and why did n't they take the XXXX {$230.00} from my savings account and not my checking, all without my prior approval or even notification. The rep did not have an answer so I asked to be transferred to a supervisor, which he said he would do. I waited on the phone in a queue for quite a while and then was cut off and hung up on. I called again later in the day and spoke to a Paypal Supervisor, XXXX, in their office in the XXXX. He agreed that it was a problem that the system showed the funds as being available and then let me transfer the money, and that it was a problem that the second {$230.00} was taken without my approval. He said that he was submitting a trouble/problem ticket and that I will receive an email acknowledging this. I never received an email so I went on line and submitted an online email complaint. I received the email shown below so I responded saying that I would have to file a complaint with a regulatory agency.

These were valid legitimate phones -the serial numbers checked out with XXXX and XXXX - they werent blacklisted, or stolen, all XXXX phones were brand new, sealed, unopened and never used, so I decided to try to sell them on ebay. I 've never sold anything online before, but I 've seen advertisements and claims of protecting sellers, buyers, all kinds of promises were made to me before I signed up - so I felt safe initially in posting all XXXX phones. XXXX by XXXX they all sold, over the course of a week and a half - and when the XXXX phone sold, I got an email from paypal- telling me that my account was limited, and I needed to provide documentation to prove my identity. At XXXX paypal asked for a few things, but as I started uploading my information to their website - statements, bills, my identification, social security number, etc, every docment I uploaded to confirm my identity was met with a request for another XXXX DIFFERENT documents. Right when I uploaded XXXX of my last documents, a XXXX bill in my name with my address, they limited my account permanently - without appeal. They informed me they 're holding my funds for 180 days, and there 's nothing I can do about it. I 've been calling paypal XXXX a day now for a week straight, and every single person I 've talked to has given me different requirements. They all keep saying the same thing, that I agreed to their terms of service - and when I asked them why they were doing this, they said that they need to hold onto the money to protect themselves in case of chargebacks for 180 days. This is in spite of the fact that all XXXX items tracking numbers show delivered, all XXXX items received positive feedbacks and gratitude from their buyers, all XXXX items have been activated on their respective carriers without issue, and most importantly, at the time of the sale before i shipped, I was assured by paypal that I qualify for seller protection which would negate the ill effects of things such as chargebacks or item not received claims. The whole time leading up to this, i was reading stories of buyers abusing these systems to take advantage of sellers, and I was so scared at XXXX point I considered scrapping the remaining XXXX auctions and cancelling them as well as the XXXX XXXX before shipping the phone out and just selling them locally. I wish I had done that now, Paypal limited my account, not allowing me access to any of my funds for 180 days.This was all the money in the world I have to my name, and it 's locked up making interest for paypal for 6 months now. My ebay account got closed because I could n't pay the seller fees because paypal wouldnt release my money to ebay to cover the fees. The account was then sent to collections. I do n't have money to pay my rent, I 've tried calling paypal multiple times asking them why they are doing this, but keep getting canned responses. I followed their rules down to the t, I took all the precautions to protect myself, and now i 'm facing eviction. I 've provided the documentation they 've asked for, and they refuse to do anything until 180 days has passed, the last XXXX times I called on friday I was simply trying to add a bank account to my paypal account in preparation to receive my money into it, as far away as it may be ( they said XXXX XXXX ), and all XXXX attempts failed as their employees seemingly mocked and ridiculed me, telling me that im wasting my time and there 's no point in adding a bank account since I ca n't pull the money out anytime soon anyway.

07/07/2015,Money transfers,International money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"I made a payment of {$1200.00} via Western Union. I was charged a fee of {$93.00} to make a payment from the XXXX to XXXX. {$1300.00} was the total, including the transfer fee that Western Union charges. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. I am writing this on XX/XX/XXXX. Almost a year later. 

The person I was making the payment to could not pick up the funds that day, and we decided it was best to cancel and complete via another avenue given that my client was traveling and would not be in that XXXX for long and Western Unions tend to be closed early over there. Honestly, it just did not work out that day. 

Since I made the payment in CASH, and I have dealt with Western Union before ( long time customer ), I thought getting a refund on the same day, back from the agent where I had made my CASH payment, would have been a trivial thing. For I have done exactly the same before. 

The first thing I am told is that the {$93.00} would not be refunded to me. Which I found ridiculous in itself. Then I was told I would be given a check, because that the agent location did not have {$1200.00}. Even at this point, I reasoned and tried to look at it positively. I was given XXXX checks, signed by western union. XXXX of them was for {$1000.00} and the XXXX one was for {$270.00}. XXXX checks, I was told, because the largest they can write checks for is $ XXXXAfter speaking with the cash agent location, having them call WU, and WU kept saying to call back between 24-48hrs because there check department was independent from their customer service. Which makes no sense. the agent location by my house called them weekly and weekly they said they would call us back with a resolution. 

Every single time I 've called, i 've had to first give my MTCN number, which then the customer service rep says is not in the system..I then have to explain to them it was a refund that was given and withdrawn from my account, after maybe XXXX minutes of them trying to help, I get transferred, exactly the same thing happens, they have NO CLUE where to find the transaction, then I get transferred to someone else. which at this point they find the transaction, and open a new investigation and am told that I would be called back in XXXX hrs. I always tell them I already had an investigation and nobody has called. At which point they go on to open a new XXXX anyway because they have no way of helping me either. so every time I call, I spend XXXX mins if i 'm lucky .... just to get to someone who finds the case on their computer, and reopens an "" investigation ''. Nobody ever called me back. I 've been given other refunds for other transactions, but I 've never been contacted by western union regarding this XXXX particular refund. Over XXXX calls7 months ago I thought the amount of time I was spending trying to resolve this matter was reaching the total amount I was owed anyway. And I reasoned that Western Union, with due time.. actually complete their "" investigation '' and refund me my money. However almost a year later, and I have lost all hope. I will now take the appropriate steps to recovering my money, even if that means bringing Western Union to a small claims court because a XXXX later. this is just complete wreck of their moral compass for conducting business. 

So at this point, I 've lost the {$93.00} ( wu fee ) + the {$24.00} ( bank fee ) + {$1200.00} ( attempted money transfer which I never saw again ), a grand total of {$1300.00}. That number is still not even correct because it fails to factor in a year of un-accounted accumulated compounded interest because this whole time Western Union has held on to my funds, has invested, and paid to investor time and time again, but has failed to address the money it owes to me. Western Union has the ability to make a payment from XXXX part of world to another in a few seconds, I still do n't understand why it has taken this long for money to be refunded.

In fact several occurrences took almost XXXX days. This has made me late on rent previously. When I call they tell me to wait an hour, and it should clear. When the funds do n't clear and I call back, they say wait until XXXX and they will definitely clear by then, however, the funds do n't clear. It really seems like there is a scam happening that is designed to overdraw customers so that Chase may charge overdraft fees. Now, I have n't always had this problem with the QuickPay service. It seems that these issues occure like this if my account is low on funds and can be overdrawn if pending transactions clear. So, if they hold off on depositing my QuickPay funds for XXXX days, then there is a good chance I will be in the red. The misconception is that all the Chase customers, and including the Chase employees think the funds should clear within hours and within XXXX at the max. However, funds do not always clear quickly, and no one can explain why. This is currently the situation I am in. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I had XXXX in my account.

In addition, when you do become overdrawn as a result and charged a fee, they do not automatically refund you the fee based on their mistake, you have to call them and show them that there is a glitch in there system. If people do n't realize this is happening, they do n't call and Chase collects unwarranted overdraft fees.

08/10/2015,Money transfers,International money transfer,Wrong amount charged or received,,"I have an online account with Bank of America and am able to send wire transfers internationally and have done so many times, usually either dollar to dollar or dollar to XXXX transfers to myself or my husband. This is normal for me. I am a US citizen and XXXX and my work takes me to many locations abroad. This time, I sent a wire transfer on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in dollars to my dollar bank account in XXXX and the intermediary bank used by B or A converted the dollars to XXXX. I was contacted by phone by my XXXX banker and she informed me of the arrival of XXXX from an intermediary bank with instructions to deposit the transfer into my US dollar account. I was asked what I wanted to do because the arriving funds did not match the instructions. I accepted the transfer because the funds were required for a timely purchase. However, I was informed that this type of unauthorized currency conversion by an intermediary bank is illegal in XXXX. Apparently it is not in the USA. In essence, I was forced to accept the poor conversion rate. 

In XXXX I can request from my bank which intermediary bank was used to follow up with a problem, but not with B of A. I learned from B of A that the names of intermediary banks are private information that clients do not have access to. This lack of transparency is disconcerting considering that an unauthorized currency conversion can take place without consequence to any bank leaving the client to absorb any associated negative costs. In this case, I lost about {$620.00} in the conversion. 

I contacted B of A about this incident and filed a claim on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I was told that this was an anomaly and should not happen again. The Associate that I spoke with in the Claims Department 's Money Team filed a claim on my behalf to recuperate the lost funds from the intermediary bank and submitted a request for me to be placed on the "" No conversion list '' with intermediary banks. I was told by the Associate to go ahead and NOT accept the wire transfer if this happened again because this kind of unauthorized currency conversion by an intermediary bank should not be happening. 

Confident that action was being taken and that this was a one-time occurrence, I went ahead with a planned XXXX transfer on XXXX XXXX 2015. Again, I received a call from my XXXX banker two days later who informed me that the same thing had taken place with XXXX arriving from the intermediary bank instead of dollars as instructed on the wire and I was asked what I wanted to do. I followed the advice of the B of A Associate and sent the wire back. After contacting B of A a second time to report that this was indeed NOT an anomaly, I was told that B of A had done everything it was supposed to on its end and therefore had no responsibility for what took place after the money left B of A and was transferred to the intermediary bank in dollars. I was unable to file a XXXX claim because I was told that there is no action that B of A can take since the wire transfer was not accepted and is being sent back. I do not accept this lack of action and lack of responsibility for what was done by an intermediary bank affiliated with B of A to make a profit. 

I would like for this to go on file and hopefully there are enough similar cases of problems with intermediary banks that might support a stronger government position on the transparency for clients related to banks and the intermediary banks they use for money transfers. Clients with international bank accounts are now asked by the government to disclose how much they have in their accounts. This transparency is acceptable. The US government should reciprocate this and support bank clients, and US citizens, by increasing the transparency for normal clients to know the routes through intermediary banks used to complete their money transfers.

The instructions stated, : "" This is a transfer to a secure time-deposit account for a minimum of 90-days. A notice will be sent to withdraw or extend for and additional 90-days ''. 
There are several different types of deposits and deposit accounts at XXXX. XXXX type deposit is a demand-deposit, which is a bank deposit the depositor may withdraw at any time without prior notice to the bank. This type deposit is made to a checking account, which is a demand-deposit account. The other type-deposit is a time deposit, which is a bank deposit that is to remain with the bank for a specified period or on which notice must be given to the bank before withdrawal and is in total contrast to a demand-deposit or a demand-deposit account like my checking account at XXXX. So, there 's at least XXXX totally different types of deposits and different types of deposit accounts at XXXX, and XXXX definitely knows all of these facts. 
The written payment instructions instructed XXXX to credit the funds specifically to a time-deposit account for a minimum 90-day period. The special written payment instructions provided XXXX with legal notice, legal notification and thus, definite legal cognizance of the fact that the funds were to be credited by XXXX specifically and only to a time-deposit account for a specified period of 90-days, and of the fact the funds were sent to specifically make a time-deposit. XXXX received notice in writing of the specific type-deposit and type-deposit account to which XXXX was to credit the funds. 
XXXX failed to exercise good faith or ordinary care concerning its crediting of the funds. XXXX definitely made a mistake when it credited the funds to the wrong type-deposit account and the wrong type deposit account beneficiary, in contravention of the written payment instructions on the payment order it received. As I see it, the funds were sent to a nonexistent and unidentifiable account and beneficiary. XXXX 's mistakes are the sole cause of the end result of the funds credited to my checking account at XXXX. It is impossible for this to happen without XXXX 's mistakes. 
I think that I should be able to justifiably expect XXXX and every bank to have commercially reasonable internal procedures designed to process a written transfer request in strict accordance with the depositor 's written instructions, to verify the accuracy of, and compliance with, written instructions, to detect and minimize inaccuracy, and to act diligently to remedy mistakes. 
My desired resolution to this matter is for XXXX to admit the fact, in writing to me on it 's letterhead from XXXX its ' officers, that XXXX made a mistake in its ' crediting of the funds to the wrong type-deposit account when XXXX credited the funds to my checking account and not to a XXXX time-deposit account as instructed. I believed XXXX owed a duty of care in its handling the payment order and it 's crediting of the funds to the proper type deposit account. XXXX made mistakes in this transaction and I want XXXX to say it in writing to me. I want XXXX to apologize to me in it 's letter for it 's mistakes. XXXX, also should say that but for it 's mistakes, the funds would not have ended up in my checking account. 
Lastly, the relationship between XXXX and me, whether derived from common-law principles or premises upon Article XXXX or Article XXXX to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, is in the nature of an implied contract. As a result of the contract, XXXX owed a duty to exercise good faith and ordinary care concerning the crediting of the funds to the proper type-deposit account, If it could not, then it should not have accepted the payment order and the funds.

I did not order anything at this XXXX, the organisation was unknown to me. I contacted XXXX and issued a fraud alert with Paypal. 

Fearing that my accounts had been hacked, I changed passwords on every account I could think of, including XXXX. XXXX then automatically takes you through some steps to check if everything is OK. XXXX XXXX an app that I possibly had not installed myself. It was a XXXX app, and indeed I had not installed it. 
I found out that it was impossible to notify XXXX in any way about the scam and the fact that my XXXX account was perhaps involved in this. There is *no* email address or contact form to be found. 

XXXX confirmed that the payment was made via a fraudulent account and directed me to Paypal. 

Paypal does not acknowlegde my claim. They state that the payment was done from the same location as the fraud report. Therefore, they conclude that there is not enough evidence to support my claim and charge me with the task of finding evidence. 
In all this, I have already pointed out to Paypal that my XXXX account had been tampered with ( I had different passwords for XXXX and PP ), informed them of this suspicious app and repeatedly asked how their statement compares to that of XXXX ( which does acknowledge a fraudulent account ). 

On all of my questions I just get a standard reply, Paypal does not address any of my questions. Neither do they explain how I am supposed to get evidence of a hack/fraud. 

It may very well be that the payment was done from my home. I work from home and had my computer on all morning and XXXX was open most of the time. But it is beyond me to find out, let alone prove, how this fraud was carried out. It seems to me that PP are the ones with the expertise to investigate these matters, not me.

01/05/2016,Money transfers,International money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"Hello, My name is XXXX XXXX. I am the owner of XXXX. I recently started this company selling goods on XXXX. I use PayPal to pay for my transactions with suppliers XXXX. I do this primarily because of the protection that PayPal provides to the buyer against fraud. 
I recently had my first experience where I needed this service and it seems that this service is actually Seller protection and not Buyer protection. Here is my story : I was running very low on a product that I sell ; my normal supplier went out of business so I needed another supplier quickly. There were no suppliers of this item on the website "" XXXX '' so I submitted a quote through a different website "" XXXX ''. I received about XXXX or more quotes from various suppliers for the selfie stick that I currently sell. 
The selfie stick is Bluetooth and has LED lights on the clip that holds the cell phone. I eventually chose - XXXX XXXX with "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ''. 
After many email communications to the Seller ( XXXX XXXX ) we established a price along with other details. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was provided a quote ( PI ) for the product along with photos of the product. 
XXXX pcs for {$1200.00} plus shipping {$690.00} for a total of XXXX It was exactly what I needed. That same day ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) I paid for the product and the shipping via PayPal. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the product arrives, but when I checked the product, I discovered that it was not the product that I ordered nor the product pictured on the Sellers Purchase Order ( PI ). It was in fact a cheaper version without LED lights. 
I contacted the supplier and told him what happened. He ( XXXX XXXX ) apologized a lot for the mistake. 
His resolution was for me to purchase the correct clip with the LED lights from them and they would pay to ship them to me. Then I could open each of the XXXX boxes and replace the incorrect part with the correct part. So his fix was I buy XXXX correct clips at XXXX each ( {$1200.00} ) then I spend hours opening all of these and exchanging parts. 
The solution I offered him was for me to return the product at his expense. He gets the shipping a lot cheaper than I do. And I paid for the shipping to me. 
My XXXX product has now been out of stock and it has cost me about {$10000.00}. I do n't think I should have to pay again due to this seller 's deception. ( I honestly do n't think it was a mistake. ) I disputed this with PayPal on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I then escalated it to a claim on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX because the seller does not want to do the right thing and pay to have his product returned to him. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received PayPal 's resolution to the claim. The resolution was for me to return the product to the Seller at my expense and they would refund the {$1900.00} to me once the seller has his product returned in the same condition it was sent. 
For me this is absolutely ridiculous. It will cost me more than I paid for the product just to return it. I do n't get the discounts that they have. 
So not only have I lost the current {$10000.00} in sales due to being out of stock. The sales momentum is now lost so the product is pretty much dead unless I re-due all of my marketing and promoting the product. I also lost the {$1900.00} that I spent to restock my product. 
This seller is loosing absolutely nothing. Even if the seller pays to have the product returned, they are only out the shipping cost. While I have lost HUGE, I could not even get a response from PayPal. 
They never asked to see the PI the Seller sent me ... nothing. 
I have proof of my loses. I have the ( SCAM ) PI provided by this seller. I have emails where the seller admits they made a mistake. The only thing I do n't have is BUYER protection.

I did so online, and I was assured in that online transaction that the funds would arrive on XXXX XXXX, using the XXXX feature. The aim was to replenish the Hawaii account before an overdraft.

03/18/2016,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"On XX/XX/2016, we submitted an online wire transfer from our company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to The XXXX XXXX as prepayment for a truckload of methanol that was going out the next day. This payment was seized by either our bank ( Bank of America ), or by the receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX ). It is difficult to tell just who had our money, as each bank said they did not have our money, and that the other bank was responsible. We were told that it was flagged by the Office of Foreign Asset Control ( OFAC ) as somehow being a foreign transaction, or suspicious in some way. The transaction was neither foreign, nor suspicious, as we only do domestic business selling methanol ( a fuel ) to US destinations. ( This one was XXXX to XXXX. ) We ( XXXX XXXX ) have been doing online wire transfers for several years in the normal course of our business as methanol brokers, which is well known to Bank of America. The intended recipient of this payment, The XXXX XXXX, is a major supplier of methanol, and does a large volume of business with this commodity -- much larger than ours by far -- and is thus well-known in this capacity by its bank, XXXX XXXX. The day after this seizure, we provided our bank with all of the information they asked for ( invoice, purchase order, etc ), as well as talking to multiple bank representatives, multiple times. Two days later ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the funds were still being held, so we submitted a replacement wire transfer online. This payment, too, was seized. At this point, our supplier, The XXXX XXXX, believed we had failed to pay for the XXXX loads that had gone out to us during that time, and so we paid them AGAIN for the same XXXX loads of methanol. This amounted to {$8100.00} that we paid twice, so {$16000.00} total. Some companies in our same situation may very well have lost the entire account -- and we would have lost this important account as well -- had we been unable to replace the funds ourselves while we waited for our funds to be released, which took TWO WEEKS. The second payment was released only today, XX/XX/2016, which is 16 days after the first payment was seized. At this writing, we have been able to salvage this new account by sending payments overnight in the mail, bypassing the wire process altogether. This new account will generate significant revenue for us, assuming these bureaucrats do n't succeed in killing it for us. The reason I am reporting this incident is because I believe one or both banks are systematically misappropriating funds that they hold and/or use at their discretion without just cause, while causing serious harm to the business interests of their customers ( eg - our company, and other companies like us. ) These people were given all the information they needed to make a determination as to the nature of the transaction on the FIRST day they asked for it, and yet, they continued to hold our funds for 14 more days. This is outrageous! These banks should be monitored and/or investigated for abuse / misuse of their customer 's money.

The primary reason use PayPal is for the protections I thought they provided. That and until very recently had no choice when using ebay although I still chose to use PayPal for the protection. I found myself in a bad situation where a seller on ebay sent a defective item and in the end, PayPal refused to provide the protection that they are compensated for. Processing companies make insane money for what are mostly automated transactions. They earn their money when consumers need protection and that includes against unreasonable policies where in this case, it ended up being PayPal 's policies and inability to apply common sense to the situation. After spending {$130.00} on the water heater which was defective upon arrival, the seller and PayPal found it reasonable that I would then be required to spend {$90.00} in return shipping since the seller was out of the country but yet chose to do biz in the US and knowingly is offering products where such issues will be inevitable from time to time ( no manufacturing process is perfect ). This is the perfect situation where consumers need the protection that a processing company should provide.

Incident # XXXX FBI IC3 Complaint # : XXXX FTC Complaint # : XXXX On XX/XX/2015 what I thought was a P.T. job opportunity turned out to be a scam. I was hired by "" XXXX XXXX '' as a "" XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' The duties were described as "" organizing purchase activity in a fixed region ... coordinating projects ( including making contracts, scheduling transportation, tracing shipments ), & providing documentation & reports. '' In short, the position boiled down to sourcing computer equipment and shipping it abroad, using my personal C.C. to pay for the equip. & shipping costs. 
In exchange for sourcing and shipping requested product and undergoing supply mgmt. training, I was promised a monthly salary, reimbursement for all expenditures on my credit card, commissions on "" accomplished contracts, '' an iphone, paid sick time, corp. card etc. Although I performed all tasks assigned to me timely and per "" XXXX XXXX '' procedure, I was never compensated as agreed. In fact, I was not compensated at all. Emails to the Project Coordinator regarding payment of wages went unanswered. 
Because all equip. I purchased for XXXX XXXX was charged to my personal XXXX, XXXX XXXX provided bank account info. for their supposed Corp. Acct. ( "" SunTrust Account '' ) to be used for repayment of equip. & shipping costs incurred by me. XXXX XXXX instructed me to withdraw funds from the SunTrust acct. to pay the charges incurred on my card in connection with performing my duties for XXXX XXXX. However, when I attempted to draw upon funds from the SunTrust Acct., it appeared that the acct. contained insufficient funds to cover the withdrawal. Between XX/XX/2015 & XX/XX/2015, at least XXXX of the charges I sought reimbursement for were reversed. 
As I could not afford the {$31000.00} in charges for the equipment purchased for XXXX XXXX, I emailed the Project Manager ( XXXX XXXX ) regarding reimbursement. The project manager then gave me new bank acct. info to use. This new account apparently contained sufficient funds to cover the {$31000.00} in charges incurred on my personal credit card in connection with purchasing and shipping the requested equip., & my C.C. balance was returned to {$0.00} on being XX/XX/XXXX. 
AS OF THIS UPDATED LETTER, I AM DISPUTING THE IRREGULARITIES OF ALL THE REVERSALS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT CARD. ESPECIALLY PAYMENT ON THE CARD MADE ON XX/XX/2015 WHICH WAS REVERSED ON XX/XX/2015 BY THE HOLDER OF THE SUNTRUST ACCT. A TOTAL OF 16 CALENDAR DAYS ELAPSED WHEREIN A TRANSACTION WAS PAID & FINALLY REVERSED ON THE CARD BY AN OUTSIDE HOLDER AT SUNTRUST BANK. 
The last time XXXX XXXX sent me an email was on XX/XX/2015 wherein he said he had a business trip, & that he would check on my salary & providing a corporate card. Further, he said if I needed salary ASAP that I should withdraw from my credit card & cover it with another payment. 
I have returned a total of XXXX XXXX Laptops to XXXX. I have alerted XXXX & my XXXX Credit Card Fraud Dept. The C.C. is now closed and as of this XX/XX/2015 XXXX Disputes Dept. has closed the case & I owe {$23000.00}.

I only got a message from Western Union XXXX WU XXXX today XXXX XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX that the funds are ready for pickup after several complaints to them ( but it is too late as the matter has been overtaken by events ). 
I have been using WU for over 15 years and have a Gold card ( # XXXX ). I sent {$300.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15 to a high school friend XXXX XXXX, XXXX for an urgent medical matter ; the transfer was done via telephone with my debit card, which I have used many times in the past. I provided my information, set up a test question and my information was verified. At the end of the call, I was given the Money Control Transfer Number ( MTCN ) XXXX and informed that the funds were immediately available for pick up. 
Surprisingly, my friend contacted me on XXXX/XXXX/15, informing me that he was not given the funds at a participating WU bank at the pick up location. I spent about XXXX minutes on the phone on XXXX/XXXX/15 trying to understand why the service I paid for was not rendered and got no sensible answers or any resolution. I spoke with a few reps at WU including, XXXX ( rep id XXXX ), XXXX ( a supervisor ) and XXXX ( in the XXXX Support department ), but my efforts proved futile and circular. 
Amidst the rudeness, impatience and XXXX customer service, what I could decipher from the incoherent explanations from the WU staff was that for some reason further verification was needed and that my phone number was inconsistent/incorrect/unverifiable. This is troubling on many levels : XXXX, verification was already done on XXXX/XXXX/15 when I was provided the MTCN ; XXXX, if it was n't, why was it not done and why wait 5 days until I call to report non performance on their part before they bring that up ; XXXX, I provided my phone number on XXXX/XXXX/15 and they already have it on their system as it is my main number and what I used to make the call on the said date ; XXXX, WU has already debited my account and are in possession of the funds, while refusing to honor the agreement by remitting it to the receiver ; lastly, there was no urgency exhibited by WU 's staff to right a wrong/error as chronicled here. As I was on the phone to WU, the line was "" conveniently '' cutoff a XXXX of times and I was passed from XXXX rep to another until I was jaded and moved on to do other important things like my job. 
Even after I reported this matter to WU 's corporate office on XXXX/XXXX/15, there still was no urgency to perform the service that I paid for and for which they were already delinquent. I had to gather another {$300.00} to send through a different money transmitter, while WU dilly-dallied. In the mean time because WU held on to my money illicitly, I incurred bank charges for bounced checks and the supposed receiver incurred late fees ( and immense troubles ) on his end because he was unable to pay the medical bills in a timely manner due to WU 's non performance. At the time of writing, WU is still to return my money ; they claim that they delayed my transaction for compliance reasons. If this is not an egregious breach of trust and contract, I do n't know what is. 
The purpose of sending the funds via WU has been defeated and instead they have given me more pain than gain in the transaction. Please assist in helping me obtain some accountability.

I plan to refund the full amount of {$80.00} on return of the merchandise, as is my stated policy on my XXXX auctions, but it is coercive and fraudulent for XXXX to freeze my account and disrupt other transactions over a purchase and refund where they are not a principal party or even the actual broker ( XXXX is the broker ).

And - to start with - they should never debit peoples ' XXXX accounts on the unsupported claims of third parties.

He was told that "" the money was on hold '' to come back at a later time. He went back with his US passport as ID and was told that the money was still on hold. On Sunday XXXX/XXXX/2015 he called me to inform me of this problem and I went to The Stop and Shop that I had originally sent the money from and was told that they "" had nothing to do with it '' that I had to call Western Union. I called Western Union and spoke to XXXX different representatives they kept on reciting some verbage about government sanctions and I asked to please tell me what the problem was. All the lady, XXXX told me was have your brother Fax or email a picture ID to us and "" our legal department will notify you.

Again I asked Western Union when could I expect to get my {$1000.00} back plus the fee of {$86.00} since they had failed their fiduciary responsibility to the paying customer of make the transaction as agreed. A few minutes ago I receive a short email from Western Union reading that this case had been escalated to higher department and that they would notify me when the "" investigation '' is completed. No time frame when the money would be return to me. To say the least I am very upset about this issue. I am a XXXX XXXX with the highest credentials and clearance working for the XXXX and a law abiding citizen and for this company to hold my hard earned money which my dad needs is inexcusable. I feel that Western Union has racially profiled my brother and I and this not acceptable. We were born in XXXX and have resided in the US since XX/XX/XXXX and are American citizens we are being treated as criminals by Western Union and that is very frustrating.

I was informed that everyone that could give something had already done so, and that the balance to be collected was XXXX ( about {$400.00} ), and this was my part. 
I then went to XXXX store, as I have done numerous times, and sent the money. Usually, I had to call MoneyGram and have them release the fund by answering several questions about the receiver ( place of birth, date of birth, etc ). So, I called them up. The agent told me everything was good. The money has been released, cleared for pick up. I called my folks as usual and gave them the "" Reference Number '' of the transaction. This is the number that the receiver will present at the pick up location and complete the transaction. 
He went to pick up the fund, but the agent could not pull the transaction record, even with the Reference Number. Should could not pull any transactions by his name or using any sort of ID. They told him the problem is in the USA. They called me, I called MoneyGram, and moneygram would tell me, 'ok, everything is ok now '. I will call home, they tried again, and agin. But they could not pull up the transaction. This was going on for three days. At some point they told me to ask the recipient to call Moneygram at the agent location. They called moneygram location, but they could not pull the record of this transaction. They, moneygram location in XXXX, actually read to me an error message that was popping up on their screen, which was, "" this is not a valid Reference Number ''. They further told me that even if they could pull the record, there was no place on their screen to input any question/answers the moneygram wanted to ask the recipient. They have no idea what to do if they could not pull up the transactions. Even if they could, they do n't know why they would not have to give out the fund. I then called moneygram and explained the situation again and again. By the second day, I had to send another {$400.00} to the first recipient 's wife, so she could pick up and go pay off the XXXX, while I am fighting this case. 
XXXX of the final conversations I had with this moneygram people was that I should go back to the store and have the money retracted. So, I did. But when I asked for the retraction at XXXX, moneygram then told their agent it was not possible. They said, the only way this fund can be released is after they have spoken with the recipient. First, the recipient had done everything humanly possible to speak with them, but it was impossible. Secondly, the recipient is now in the hospital. And, thirdly, they blamed USA Govt for their own policies. They said, this is what US govt wanted them to do. This is a XXXX watch list that was put together by the US. And, that I could not get this money back. I said, this is not right. They can not be the police, the judge and the executioner all at the same time. This is really un-America. So, I called the police, and the police, after hearing me tell him that I could not get my money back because the recipient 's or similar name was on a XXXX watch list, he actually was kind of glad I did not succeed in sending the money. He actually asked me why I should get the money back. He automatically assumed I was not a citizen. He said, 'those of us that are citizens, we can easily work to the court house and file a complaint ' as a civil matter. So, I asked him, if I would have to be a citizen in order to be heard? He said, no. But the damage was already done. This is in XXXX, NC. Can you believe my luck ; it just seemed that the nightmare wo n't end for me.

05/18/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"I received a {$35.00} NSF charge from XXXX. I have checked out of "" Overdraft Protection '' at XXXX to stop these NSF charges. I utilize a low balance account/debit card to pay for items that I purchase online. If the card/account were to be "" compromised '' the hackers would not get much/anything. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a {$36.00} NSF charge to my account for a {$11.00} charge from XXXX on a recurring charge that bills thru PayPal. I immediately called XXXX and they stated that I was afforded a "" XXXX time courtesy '' earlier in the year. 

I contacted PayPal and ask why they did not use my secondary payment method ... ... XXXX XXXX, and I was told that when the charge was sent by ACH to XXXX XXXX, PayPal had no way to check the account balance. Therefore they would do nothing. 

XXXX XXXX said they were charging the NSF fee because they provided a service in returning the charge. XXXX XXXX had paid the charge of {$11.00} to XXXX. On my PayPal statement it shows paid. XXXX XXXX stated that it would take XXXX days for the charge to reverse. 

XXXX XXXX computer triggers a NSF to PayPal, knowing that I have opted out of "" Overdraft Protection ''. XXXX XXXX then informs me that they are charging me for a "" administrative handling fee ''. 

PayPal says they have no way of knowing if the account has a positive balance or not and therefore I am at fault for the charges even though I have XXXX XXXX as a backup funding source. 

While XXXX XXXX generate over XXXX XXXX dollars in overdraft and NSF fees each year, I can understand how they would try and circumvent the "" Overdraft Protection Opt Out '' so they could charge the {$36.00} fee. 

PayPal does not allow a customer to remove their bank accounts or bank cards from their system and use the following charge sequence:XXXX Default Payment Methods. When you make a payment, if you have not selected a Preferred Payment Method, PayPal will fund your transaction in this order : a. Balanceb. Instant Transfer from your bank accountc. PayPal Creditd. PayPal Cardse. Debit cardf. Credit cardg. eCheckYou give PayPal the right to resubmit any ACH debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. No consumer knows this as it is hidden in their TOS and if you do not accept the TOS then you can not open a PayPal account. 

PayPal will then use your bank account as the primary source of funding regardless if you have chosen a credit card as your primary payment method. By moving the credit card to the bottom of the charge sequence, PayPal avoids the credit card fee thus improving their bottom line. 

I utilized the "" Overdraft Protection Opt Out '' with the express intent of AVOIDING any bank charges beyond the {$6.00} they charge each month because I will not deposit thousands of dollars in this particular account. Obviously XXXX XXXX wants my {$36.00} really bad and will do most anything to get it. 

I find it ironic that XXXX XXXX touts their "" ETHICS ''. I would suggest that XXXX XXXX is void of "" ANY ETHICS '' if they will stoop the the lows they have exhibited in regard to this fiasco. 

If both XXXX XXXX and PayPal are doing this to me, you can bet they are doing this to millions of others too. XXXX can only imagine the "" XXXX '' of dollars they are making on these unscrupulous business practices. 

While I expect nothing to happen, hopefully enough people will stop doing business with these XXXX "" modern day XXXX XXXX '' collective of thieves. But then one can only dream.

06/25/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"My family members and I have had a terrible experience with this company. This company has proven that it does not care about its customers. Since it is obvious that I am not going to get any assistance from this company I am writing this in every place that I can think of to help other consumers avoid the mistake that my family made. There are similar companies like XXXX XXXX that will offer you the same services but with a much better outcome. 

My mother sent me a money gram and it was impossible to pick it up. She went to the store and told me that I needed to pick it up within 90 days and that I should pick it up yesterday. At the store she sent it at, they told her that it would not be a problem for me to pick it up yesterday and even if it was after 90 days I could just call MoneyGram and they would assist me with picking it up at whatever time I needed it. 

On yesterday, I went to CVS to pick the money up. I used the kiosk and spoke to a money gram customer service agent ; he was rude and so were all of the other agents I spoke with. Furthermore, he purposely took down my license number incorrectly. He repeated the things that I said so I know that I gave him the right license number. He told me that I would be able to receive the money and to pick it up from the CVS cashier. The CVS cashier told me that I could not receive the money because there was a block on the money and because my license number was written down wrong. So I went back to the kiosk to call the money gram customer service officials again and the individuals kept hanging up. This kept going on for over XXXX hours. I would call, they would hang up immediately, put me on hold, transfer me, give me the wrong information, yell at the CVS store clerk and blame the problem on him, and/or eventually hang up with no assistance to me. There was XXXX guy who was exceptionally rude and he refused to give me his name. He constantly kept hanging up on me. I think his behavior is extremely unprofessional and he should be fired. Basically, I spent hours trying to reach customer service agents and they refused to assist me. The store clerk was there to witness this. I was in a store alone until XXXX and I had to walk back to my apartment by myself ; my elderly XXXX mother who is in a different time zone was up until XXXX in the morning worried about everything. 

I know that this was very unprofessional and just plain rude and they just did not want to release the money. I think that this is unacceptable and something should be done about this. MoneyGram it would be very considerate of you if you realize that your consumers are human and you treat them as such. Furthermore, consumers please be wary of this company.

However when I paid for the transaction ( Attachment XXXX ) in question it did not give me the option and instead debited my bank account.

Further when I responded to them ( Attachment XXXX ) highlighting the mistake and security concerns, they have not bothered to respond. Request to take it up with paypal.

Following are the basis :1. Incorrect Name/Case No : my name is XXXX XXXX as against XXXX XXXX, indicated in the below mail. further my case no is XXXX as against XXXX indicated in below response ( extract of original mail with case no below ).

2. When I sign up to paypal, the basis of my sign up is the flexibility of payment sources. However for below payment it did not offer me the said flexibility and without checking debited my primary source of payment being my bank account. This is unacceptable and hence I had requested reversal and it being charged to my credit card. You can not deny me the choice of selecting a payment source when it is part of the service offerred. 

I also demand compensation, as I suspect due to lapse of control at your end you have shared my contact details with a third party ( below mail is an example ). Should you not be able to provide a satisfactory answer plan to take it up with the regulatory authority like Consumer Financial Protection Bueareu ( CSFB ) and press.

I have called, left voicemails, emailed, and even try to get assistance through the Walmart were the transaction took place.

I gave my aunt the reference number stated on the receipt for her to receive the money on XXXX/XXXX/2015 same day I did the transaction, my aunt claims she went to various locations and they told her the reference/account number did n't exist, when I paid for money in minutes service.

So we agreed on her to try again on XXXX/XXXX/15 incase the transaction was delayed.

Their web site states, when cancelling a transaction, that it should take between 3 and 10 business days to get the funds back in the bank account, so one would think that it should start counting 3-10 business days when they do the cancellation. No clue that, before that, there is an arbitrary number of days that MoneyGram takes to "" properly process '' the cancellation request. Hilarious, ridiculous, frustrating.

10/23/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"On the morning of XXXX XXXX, 2015, I woke up to several messages on my phone indicating that money had been transferred using my Google Wallet account. Assuming that my account had been hacked, I logged into my account from my computer, changed my password and began investigating. I found that XXXX {$300.00} transfers had been made to email addresses I was unfamiliar with. There were also a number of failed transfers for {$200.00} and {$300.00}. I am unaware of the reason some transactions went through at this time and others did not. In addition, {$500.00} had been loaded onto my Google Wallet account from my checking account ( with a {$14.00} transaction fee attached ), but was still there. Presumably, I logged in and changed the password before the hackers had the opportunity to do what they had intended with this money. 
At this point, I called Google 's customer support number to try to resolve the issue. The customer service agent I spoke with advised me that they would need to contact their resolutions department so that they could evaluate the charges. After waiting on hold, she came back and informed me that because the charges originated from my email address, they did not consider it to be an instance of hijacking, and as a result would not reverse any of the transactions. At this point, I pointed out that their own security page showed someone logging in from roughly XXXX XXXX miles from my location at the time the transactions took place, and that this seemed to be the very definition of hijacking. I was asked to hold again while she contacted the resolutions team to bring this to their attention. After another wait on hold I was told that their decision held, and that Google would not reverse any of the charges. 
At this point, the customer service agent gave me what, in hindsight, has been some of the worst advice I have ever received. She advised that since Google could not take care of the charges, that I should at least transfer the {$500.00} remaining in my Google Wallet account back to my checking account. I would be out the transaction fee, but at least I would have recovered the {$500.00}. I followed her advice and transferred the money. 
After speaking with one of the personal bankers at my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I filed a Card Transaction Dispute for the XXXX {$300.00} transfers. Since I had already transferred the {$500.00} I did not dispute this charge. I remained out the {$14.00} for the transaction fee, but decided I could handle that if the rest of the money were returned. I also filed a complaint with the California XXXX in the hopes that this would elicit a response from Google. In response to one, or both of these, Google reversed the XXXX {$300.00} charges. In addition, they did something with the {$500.00} charge, although it was not processed as a chargeback. On my Google Wallet Summary, where the other charges show up as "" Returned, '' this charge shows up as "" Failed. '' It cancelled the transaction in Google Wallet, but did not transfer me any money, presumably because I had already transferred the money back to my account. The end result is that while they did not give me {$500.00}, my Google Wallet account shows up as - {$500.00}. 
In my latest ( and last ) round of trying to deal directly with Google 's customer support, I was told that Google had initiated a chargeback with a reference number that I can provide, and that I could verify that the chargeback had gone through by contacting the card issuing bank. I have done so, and neither they, nor I, can find a chargeback in the amount of {$510.00} going onto my account. The closest we can find is the initial {$500.00} transfer that I have described above.

I said I wanted to complete the transaction now ; would the fee be {$5.00}? She replied that the fee should be {$5.00}, but that they were required to read the disclaimer.

01/05/2016,Money transfers,International money transfer,Other service issues,,"This complaint covers several issues with PayPal where they are overstepping their authority as a money transfer company. 
First Complaint : PayPal "" randomly '' by their own CSR statements, holds funds in pending on fully established accounts that are in good standing even though the funds have been received. ( I suggest you XXXX - "" PayPal Pending '' where you will find multiple threads and sites including PayPal 's own complaint site where you will find literally thousands of complaints for this action. ) Then they force the "" seller '' to ship the goods with pending funds and wait for receipt and acknowledgment by the "" buyer '' before the funds are released to the seller. ( Copies of e-mail documents attached ) The seller 's balance sheet shows that the funds were received and "" completed '' then moved to "" pending ''. While the account balance at the top of the PayPal home page shows the total balance including the pending funds, the actual ledger page shows these funds have been removed. ( ledger sheets attached ) Question - Where are these "" pending '' funds actually being held and by who? Is this a kiting operation since thousands of sellers have funds being held in pending at any given time. Per PayPal CSR "" Everyone has to do this occasionally. It 's a random thing we do for security purposes. Just ship the item! "". Note : This statement was made by the CSR after having been transferred to EBay, being told by EBay it 's not us and another EBay CSR saying OK I 've released the funds check your PayPal now and seeing nothing change then being transferred back to PayPal. The holding of funds prior to shipment on established accounts is redundant as other rules in the agreement will automatically put seller funds into pending upon a complaint until it is resolved - even if it is up to 6 months after the sale. This brings up the next complaint. 

Second complaint : PayPal is acting like a "" Warranty '' company by forcing sellers to refund money up to six months after the sale. Even in the case of a "" New in the Box '' item most manufactures only have a 90 day warranty. Additionally the resolution to warranty of most new items that fail during the first 90 days is to contact the manufacture 's toll free number for a return merchandise authorization with paper work that expressly states "" do not return this item to the place of purchase ''. By using the reason "" not as described '' a buyer can return an item that failed or that they physically broke for a full refund beyond the manufacture 's warranty period or the sellers usual 30 day warranty period without inspection and without recourse by the seller. There are many documented cases where the seller had money removed from their account for a refund on an item and did not even get the item returned back to them. The buyer kept the item and the money. This becomes even more dubious when many of the items that are sold on EBay, XXXX and other online companies are "" used '' or "" for parts or not working '' and carry no manufacture 's warranty. Even when the seller warrants a product to be working for a period of time, PayPal overrides that period of time. Unless PayPal is willing to absorb the cost they do not have the authority under law to enforce these kind of refunds by taking money from a seller up to six months after a sale. I would think that this is a violation of Federal Trade Commission regulations. 
Third Complaint : PayPal is a Bank as it operates as a complete banking system. Not only is it holding money for customers in accounts that draw interest which is captured and used by PayPal. Purchases made with the PayPal Credit card show up on my PayPal balance sheet. I just made a credit card payment on the PayPal site from my bank account. That payment is also being held as pending and may cause a late payment as the credit card has not acknowledged payment as they usually do.

02/05/2016,Money transfers,International money transfer,Other service issues,,"I am writing because of what I perceive to be a blatantly dishonest practice on the part of Western Union and because I have tried many, many times to contact the company through every means of communication they offer and have been unable to reach anyone who can or will help with a resolution or even take the time to answer XXXX simple question. Here is the problem. When you transfer money with Western Union they offer XXXX main methods of payment, XXXX of which are transferring directly from a bank account and transferring from a credit or debit card. Every single time I transfer money with them and select to use my bank account, the less expensive option, I always get a message stating the transaction could not be completed using the selected payment method and directing me to choose another payment method. Yet as soon as I switch to using my bank debit card, from the same bank and connected to the same bank account, and also the more expensive option, the transaction goes through just fine immediately every single time. The difference in fees between these XXXX payment methods is substantial, many times the fee is literally double to use the debit card option! 

I have discussed this with my bank and they have assured m they are not blocking or restricting the transaction in any way whatsoever, and that it is not a fault in their system, so the problem definitely is on Western Union 's end of the transaction. When I call their "" customer service '' agents on the phone I am told by them that for "" security reasons '' they are not given access to the information that would enable them to tell me why this problem continuously occurs, they are not able to give me any further information and they can not give me a solution other than to tell me to try again later. I have emailed Western Union several times through the main email address for customer service on their website and through an additional email given for their customer service advocate department and no one will respond or get back to me to help me resolve this issue. All of these things cause me to feel like these practices are intentional on Western Union 's part and that I and other people who are undoubtedly having the same problem with Western Union are being cheated by this company to force us to pay the higher, often double fees. I am a patient and courteous man but I have tried every XXXX available to resolve this directly with Western Union and they simply will not respond and help me or even take the simple common courteousy to offer me any explanation whatsoever! 

Therefore it is finally in frustration that I turn to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for help in this matter because I am really concerned that Western Union has a dirty, dishonest practice that is cheating me and a lot of other people out of a lot of extra money! Please take the time look into this matter and do kindly reply and let me know how the bureau may be able to help us bring a resolution to this matter.

After I confirmed my name, my friends name and location, the Transfer in Minutes fee for sending {$1500.00} was {$80.00}. So I agree to that and pay the money, I got a Reference # XXXX and they said the money should be available to pick up in XXXX in a mater of minutes. But that never happened because the second day XXXX XXXX I called moneyGram to check the status of the transaction and they said the transaction is under review and that they need to transfer me to a different department that has some question for me. So they transfer me and I waited 20 min and nobody answered.I called 2nd time after ~1h and same story I was transferred to this department that never answers ... and waited for ~32 min this time ... still no answer so I give up. XXXX XXXX in the evening I go to a money gram location next to my house to try to get some answers, I used their Red phone again and guess what, same story I had to wait to talk to this department and they said it may take more the 40 min or 1 hour. So I told them that in this case I just want to cancel the tansaction, because it is not money in minutes transaction anymore, almost a full day past by and I spent XXXX on the phone trying to understand what do they need to review. 
XXXX day the XXXX XXXX 2016 I called them again, same story this time they transfer me and this department finally picked up after just ~15 min waiting for them. And they asked me the same question that they had asked me when I first made the transaction on the phone, my name, my friends name ( the receiver ) and so on ... that finally they come up with this reason that the transaction has to much risk and that they will refund my the money. Now I got a new reference # that I hope I can use it to get my money back, I have not got to and MoneyGram office yet. So this was after min ~ 35 h from when I made the transaction and payed the money for it. So the SCAM that MoneyGram IS DOING is that they have use my money ~ $ XXXX {$80.00} fee ) for ~35 h and as they work almost all over the world they probably do this for XXXX of people like me and are able to block huge amount of money just for at least 24 h so they can collect interest on it or invest the money or whatever. For a service that is called money transfer in minutest that actually blocks your own money for more then 24 h that is outrageous and most probably illegal.

There was also a link which I could change the method of payment ( funding source ) which took me to the apps wallet. The only methods I could use for funding the payment was my PayPal balance or PayPal Credit. I could not choose any of other PayPal confirmed approved methods of payment ( funding source ), such as my attached checking account or multiple credit cards. I called PayPal and spoke with a Rep.

03/27/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I applied for the Barclay Platinum MasterCard credit card. It was a promotion to transfer a balance with 0 % interest for XXXX billing cycles. I requested a balance transfer of {$10000.00} from another credit card to the new Barclay MasterCard. 
I received the new card on XXXX/XXXX/2015 with a credit limit of {$1500.00}. Because it was not the credit limit I was hoping for I did n't activate the card and was thinking about closing the account. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I received an email that a {$1000.00} payment posted to the credit card that I asked the {$10000.00} to be transferred to. I still had n't activated the new Barclay card yet and was going to cancel it. 
I called Barclay customer service and told them that the {$1000.00} was an unauthorized transfer and it happened without my knowledge or consent. They waived the {$30.00} transfer fee but told me that they could n't reverse the charges because it was already paid. I advised them that this was unauthorized transfer and that Barclay did it without authorizing it through me and did the transfer anyway and using an arbitrary amount of their own choosing and an amount other than what I agreed to on the application. 

I said that since it was in my mind an unauthorized transaction the responsibility of it falls on them to reverse this transaction and the burden to send them money is not on me. They said no, it could n't be done because it already was processed. I requested the new Barclay MarsterCard account to be closed. 
My point is that since my initial credit card balance was only {$1500.00}, which was way less than the {$10000.00} transfer amount that I requested that the transfer was not going to happen. Furthermore, I had not activated the card and was considering if I was going to keep it or not. 

It is my view that Barclay acted on their own performing transactions without me knowing about it not verifying with me if these were my wishes. If they would have contacted me and asked if I still wanted to transfer a balance since my initial credit line was way smaller than the transfer amount I requested it would have had a very different outcome. 

The Results I am requesting to resolve this complaint:XXXX ) Barclay to immediately reverse the {$1000.00} transfer with no cost to me whatsoever.

I called them again on on XX/XX/XXXX and was told they are still waiting for a response. I called again on XXXX XXXX and there was still no resolution. 
I discussed with my supplier and he was willing to wire the money back minus the {$10.00} deduction his bank made and any charges they would make for a wire. Chase on the other hand said they couldnt do anything about the reduced amount but would credit any of their own fees. They said they were not responsible for any fees on the receiving bank 's side. I aksed if it would be better for me to await Chase 's resolution or request the supplier to return the money. They were non-committal but finally admitted that perhaps having the supplier return the money would me more timely. 
How can I be made to beg for my own money. I ca n't believe Chase has been so incompetent and unapologetic for their mistake. What if my account goes overdraft! I ca n't believe I am expected to be in the red for a Chase system error, which they are not taking responsibility for, but admit.

I made several attempts through PayPal to refund the money directly back to the person that sent it originally - XXXX XXXX but was unable to do so because PayPal refused to send payment to a personal account in XXXX XXXX After telling XXXX that I was unable to send the refund to XXXX XXXX, he said he understood and for me to send it back to a different email address-one that was a "" business '' account, but turned out to be XXXX XXXX. I held onto the funds until PayPal verified that the money was indeed in my PayPal account and ready for transfer. I then transferred the money to my bank account. After receiving NUMEROUS phone calls daily from XXXX, and verifying through my bank and PayPal that the money was indeed there, I refunded the {$1500.00} to where XXXX told me to.

When I asked Ally Bank why the transfer was denied, they informed me that my signature was not notarized by a notary public with a notary stamp. She said anyone could signed a transfer document. I told her that I had signed it and that I was giving her verbal authorization to make the transfer. I told her that she had asked me at least XXXX security questions to verify that I was the owner of the account in questions before we began the discussion of my IRA. There is no logic why after successfully answering the security questions that Ally Bank refused to accept my verbal acknowledgement that I ( the owner of the IRA accounts ) legitimently requested the transfer. The Ally Bank representative agreed with me but said the notary public notarization was their procedure. So I reprinted and filled out the Transfer Requests for a second time and had them notarized and signed by a notary public. I called Ally Bank bank to let them know that I uploaded a copy of the new "" Transfer Request '' forms to my new bank and that they would send them the new transfer request. It was from this XXXX discussion that I was told that these requests would also be denied because they were uploaded copies and not the original forms. These kind of onerous rules have no place for an online bank who touts the ease of their software to fill an individuals banking needs. At the very least when I was initially informed that my transfer request was denied, I should have been emailed the precise requirements that needed to be performed to submitt successful transfer form. Instead I accidentally stumbled across the requirement that the transfer request forms had to be the original ones. At the most, when I call Ally Bank and successfully answer all the security questions but then still can not direct how my accounts are to be handled goes counter to having an online bank account. This is wrong and in my opinion over kill when the owner of an account can not call Ally directly to direct how their account is to be handled.

He said that he would open back up a ticket to have the Wells Fargo XXXX research team investigate further into the funds that I am still missing. He also asked if I could forward you a copy of any information that I have that would aid in this process. With that said, I have attached a screen shot copy of the Record of my Wire Transfer, as well as the Federal Reference Number of the wire transfer which is XXXX. Please keep in mind that the letter XXXX could be a zero in the Federal Reference Number but either way, both XXXX Bank as well as the regular Wells Fargo Bank, were both able to show that the funds were wired to Wells Fargo XXXX. 

To bring you up to speed, I wired {$2900.00} from my XXXX Bank account to my Wells Fargo Bank CHECKING account on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX EST, or so I thought. When I did not see the money in my CHECKING account the next day, I immediately checked my records and saw that I accidentally put my Wells Fargo XXXX credit card account number ending in XXXX instead. I immediately called XXXX Bank to inform them of my error and the bank representative informed me that it should not be a problem because the receiving bank will see that it went to a credit card and will just need to reject it. I was told that it would be back into my XXXX bank account in two business days. Well XXXX XXXX, it 's been two weeks and I still have not received my transfer money, nor does your bank seem to know where it is either. I spoke with a personal banker at Wells Fargo Bank by the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) more than a week ago about the missing wire transfer. He told me as instructed by someone from Wells Fargo XXXX or Wells Fargo Bank, to get the federal reference number and call XXXX. I did as instructed and spoke to a representative by the name of XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. He was able to use the the Federal Reference number to see that the {$2900.00} did in fact go to Wells Fargo XXXX and that I would have to call them to rectify the matter. I did as instructed and spoke to XXXX representative XXXX, who transferred me to Team Lead XXXX XXXX, who transferred me to Manager XXXX XXXX. All of whom were not able to do anything as far as locating my missing wire transfer. They said there screen would only let them look into the matter so far but that the Wells Fargo XXXX research team was looking into it. 

Feeling very frustated to my surprise, I finally received a call from XXXX XXXX who said they will reopen the research with the evidence that I have just presented you. 1. A screen shot of my wire transaction sent to Wells Fargo XXXX card ending in XXXX. 2. ) The Federal Reference number that shows where the money went. 3. ) The wire identifier number from my wire transfer receipt which is XXXX. 4. ) The transaction number which is XXXX. 5. ) The Routing/ABA Number which was XXXX. 6. ) The account number that it was sent to which is XXXX. 7. ) The day the wire was created which was on XXXX/XXXX/15 but it officially went out the next business day which was XXXX/XXXX/15 in the amount of {$2900.00}. 

In closing, I am highly frustrated that a bank as large a Wells Fargo and as long as they have been around, can not find funds from a simple wire transfer. Whether it 's Wells Fargo Bank or Wells Fargo XXXX, to me it 's still under the Wells Fargo umbrella and I 'm highly disappointed with the company as a whole. I do n't know how you all communicate with each other but I need this situation resolved.

I filed a complaint against seller, weeks later Paypal tells me only way to resolve the case was to ship it back to seller at my own cost, after I had already paid the costs to repair machine because I needed to use it and did n't have enough money extra to buy a second welder while I waited on a response from Paypal. I appealed this decision, Paypal contacted seller for their response, seller did not agree to a refund and Paypal told me there was nothing they could do. At this point nearly 60 days had passed so I contacted my credit card issuer to do a chargeback, they have no online dispute process so I 'm forced to mail dispute information and after receiving it credit card company tells me that because they did n't receive it within 60 days of the original charge they are unwilling to do anything to help me. I believe that Paypal deliberately draws out the length of their dispute resolution process to avoid the possibility of a chargeback when they fail to protect their customers from negligent or scamming sellers.

09/11/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"The wire-transfer to Chase contemplated a credit by Chase to a specific type deposit account for a specified amount of time, which was stated in the form of written payment instructions. The instructions stated, : "" This is a transfer to a secure time-deposit account for a minimum of 90-days. A notice will be sent to withdraw or extend for and additional 90-days ''. 
There are several different types of deposits and deposit accounts at Chase. One type deposit is a demand-deposit, which is a bank deposit the depositor may withdraw at any time without prior notice to the bank. This type deposit is made to a checking account, which is a demand-deposit account. The other type-deposit is a time deposit, which is a bank deposit that is to remain with the bank for a specified period or on which notice must be given to the bank before withdrawal and is in total contrast to a demand-deposit or a demand-deposit account like my checking account at Chase. So, there 's at least XXXX totally different types of deposits and different types of deposit accounts at Chase, and Chase definitely knows all of these facts. 
The written payment instructions instructed Chase to credit the funds specifically to a time-deposit account for a minimum 90-day period. The special written payment instructions provided Chase with legal notice, legal notification and thus, definite legal cognizance of the fact that the funds were to be credited by Chase specifically and only to a time-deposit account for a specified period of 90-days, and of the fact the funds were sent to specifically make a time-deposit. Chase received notice in writing of the specific type-deposit and type-deposit account to which Chase was to credit the funds. 
Chase failed to exercise good faith or ordinary care concerning its crediting of the funds. Chase definitely made a mistake when it credited the funds to the wrong type-deposit account and the wrong type deposit account beneficiary, in contravention of the written payment instructions on the payment order it received. As I see it, the funds were sent to a nonexistent and unidentifiable account and beneficiary. Chase 's mistakes are the sole cause of the end result of the funds credited to my checking account at Chase. It is impossible for this to happen without Chase 's mistakes. 
I think that I should be able to justifiably expect Chase and every bank to have commercially reasonable internal procedures designed to process a written transfer request in strict accordance with the depositor 's written instructions, to verify the accuracy of, and compliance with, written instructions, to detect and minimize inaccuracy, and to act diligently to remedy mistakes. 
My desired resolution to this matter is for Chase to admit the fact, in writing to me on it 's letterhead from one of its ' officers, that Chase made a mistake in its ' crediting of the funds to the wrong type-deposit account when chase credited the funds to my checking account and not to a Chase time-deposit account as instructed. I believed Chase owed a duty of care in its handling the payment order and it 's crediting of the funds to the proper type deposit account. Chase made mistakes in this transaction and I want Chase to say it in writing to me. I want Chase to apologize to me in it 's letter for it 's mistakes. Chase, also should say that but for it 's mistakes, the funds would not have ended up in my checking account. 
Lastly, the relationship between Chase and me, whether derived from common-law principles or premises upon Article XXXX or Article XXXX to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, is in the nature of an implied contract. As a result of the contract, Chase owed a duty to exercise good faith and ordinary care concerning the crediting of the funds to the proper type-deposit account, If it could not, then it should not have accepted the payment order and the funds.

The money was originally sent as a small loan to help me with repairs to my car which is necessary for me to get to and from work as there is no public transport near where I work. The result has been that I had to use my own funds and I will now not have enough money to pay my rent. Obviously this is getting desperate for me and yet this could all be resolved if Wells Fargo would release MY money and complete the transfer started 6 weeks ago. 

It should be noted that I had a transfer of funds from XXXX sent about 18 months ago using the same information which reached my account in about 3 days. 

I am aware of UDAAP and I believe this situation falls into the category of Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts or Practices. It is certainly unfair to be withholding my funds and causing me financial hardship for no good cause. The potential I face now where I could be evicted is most certainly abusive. I am not asking for anything more than to have the transfer completed. I am hopeful you can help get this resolved for me before time runs out for me to pay my rent. I would also appreciate any advice you can give. For example : should I be seeking legal assistance or maybe take this to the press to put pressure on Wells Fargo Bank? 

The Assistant Manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX has been in contact with the sending bank in XXXX over a week but to date there has been no indication of a resolution. Please do not let Wells Fargo Bank get away with this treatment. I am desperate for this transfer to be completed. 

As far as compensation is concerned I only wish the the transfer be completed. Having said that, if my father or myself were to incur any additional costs or expenses as a direct result of this situation then in that circumstance I would seek that such costs were covered by Wells Fargo. If Wells Fargo had sent the transfer through in the first place then there would be no issue.

11/03/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"On or about XXXX/XXXX/2015 I, -name redacted-, tried to transfer funds in the amount of {$1600.00} to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account number -redacted- from my Venmo account. I was messaged by Venmo ( and still have this message ) saying that this transaction was cancelled by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This turned out to be a lie. XXXX XXXX contacted me ( I still have the messages ) saying that the transfer process was never initiated by Venmo. What that means to me is that Venmo never even INTENTED for me to have my money. The reason why is for financial forensic investigators to find out, not me, and really is irrelevant at this point. 
On Venmo 's website, it says this about bank transfers : "" If you received a notification from Venmo that your transfer to bank failed, the funds from the failed transfers to bank should already be back in your Venmo balance. '' This is also a blatant lie. Today is XXXX XXXX. 
Venmo 's site says that if you place a customer service request with them, they try to respond within XXXX hours. This is an egregious lie, because as of yet, I have only received an automated message saying that they received my request. As a business owner, it boggles my mind that a company which processes money transfers in the XXXX of dollars, only works XXXX hours per week, but I am starting to see why this is the case. 
On Venmo 's website, it instructs the consumer that if a transfer fails, it is most likely the fault of the consumer inputting their banking information incorrectly, so they should try to re-input their account information. This point is irrelevant, as in my checking account from the XXXX forward, Venmo, in an attempt to verify my account, on XXXX/XXXX/2015 withdrew {$0.00} from my account that I still have not gotten back, so from that transaction, one may be able to deduce that they had the right account and routing numbers to make the deposit of {$1600.00}, and at the same time precludes the notion that I gave Venmo incorrect account info. 
As I have previously stated, I have attempted to contact Venmo, however their hours of operation are severely limited, and also, and this is only conjecture on my part, but after reading the following Slate article, XXXX, I do not think that they even at all TRY to get back in touch with their customers, because this has already been proven more than once ( unless the media is involved, which is my very next step prior to class action ). So at this point, I do not need very many more people to start a class action lawsuit, I just need to file reports such as this one, to make sure I 've done all I can do to resolve this situation BEFOREHAND. At no time did I notify or attempt to notify Venmo or XXXX to cancel my transfer of {$1600.00} to my XXXX account. This transfer was cancelled without my knowledge, consent, or authorization. 
If any other information is requested from me that would be helpful, by all means please let me know, as I would love to handle this situation at the lowest level possible without utilizing costly legal representation and private investigative services for such an amount, however, I am quickly realizing that I probably will have no choice but to do so as a matter of principle and for all others going through this same issue, but do not know what recourse to undertake. I certify that I did NOT conduct Venmo transaction # XXXX for any type of business, commercial, or merchant transactions or reasonings.

Wells Fargo was my bank back home in XXXX but they would not allow me to wire money to myself without physically being present at a branch in XXXX nor do an online transfer, so I transferred {$26000.00} of my own personal money into my business partner and my joint bank account with Wells Fargo and had him wire the money into the condo owner 's personal bank account at XXXX here in the XXXX. The money was wired by my business partner on behalf of me on XXXX XXXX, 2015. My business partner was told that it could take up to 7 business days for the wire to go through. 7 business days later and the money is not there according to the local XXXX XXXX here, so I have my business partner go back to Wells Fargo and ask them where the missing money is. Wells Fargo then stated that they would have to an 'investigation ' in order to figure out where the money was at. Incredibly, Wells Fargo then told my business partner that this investigation could take up to two weeks. I was absolutely appalled that it would take 2 weeks to find out where my missing money was at being that it took me all of 45 minutes to figure it out in hindsight. After this 'thorough ' 2 week investigation during which Wells not once contacted me to let me know what was going on nor did they even tell us that the investigation was even complete, Wells Fargo XXXX bold conclusion was that XXXX did indeed have the money the whole time which later and amazingly still turned out to be wrong. Amazing that it took XXXX weeks to come to an incorrect conclusion while my money is getting destroyed by the USD because of the currency conversion. Next, after proceeding down the local XXXX branch here, the local rep tells me that they had rejected the wire transfer 3 days after it was sent and gave me the rejection reference number because Wells Fargo sent it to the wrong XXXX entity and used the wrong SWIFT code. I tell my business partner to go into the branch yet again to get this problem resolved and he tells the Wells rep around the XXXX of XXXX to accept the rejection and deposit the money back into my account using the reference number XXXX had given me. The Wells Fargo rep then proceeds to make another startling mistake by assuming that we wanted the money to be sent again and awaited new wire instructions thus delaying my money getting redeposited again and allowing the USD to continue bludgeoning the XXXX. And finally on XXXX XXXX, 2015 ( an INCONCEIVABLE 30 DAYS after my wire was sent ) and I finally get my money back in the amount of {$25000.00} and Wells Fargo is trying to tell me that I am responsible for the currency changes during this 30 days?? {$1800.00}! A whopping XXXX % of my money gone due to banking incompetence. Wells Fargo is the entity that put in the wrong swift code to begin with and wired the money to the wrong bank. I provided the correct wiring instructions and Wells Fargo screwed it up. Secondly, let 's assume that I did send the wrong info and Wells Fargo did everything correctly. This money should at the very least have been redeposited immediately after the wire was rejected on XXXX XXXX, 2015 during which the XXXX would not have been killed by the USD. In addition to this, when the money was wired from Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX, 2015 they gave me an unconscionable rate from USD to XXXX of XXXX. The actual rates at this time were closer to XXXX thus Wells Fargo positioned itself by currency manipulation such that under no circumstances could I get my initial wire back in the full amount because when it was transferred back at the actual rate of around XXXX again, the money was now only {$25000.00}. Bottom line is that Wells Fargo manipulated the currency rate and made it impossible for me to get back my full wire.

I asked XXXX whether his insurance would cover such a fraud, but he claimed they would n't since he did nothing wrong. All XXXX did is make clear his only interest was completing the closing procedure and did not show any concern for my tremendous loss ; he even had the indecency to call me while I was franticly at my bank, to ask whether I had other funds I could use to close. Closing never took place this day. XXXX eventually finally called me XXXX days later asking me how I plan to proceed. I made it clear to him I was very disappointed about the outcome and stressed this fraud issue is beyond my control. I insisted I trusted all communication coming from his email so therefore had no reason to be suspicious but he insisted he is not liable for anything. Once I mentioned I 'd then have to seek legal assistance in this matter, he stated I was creating an adversarial situation and then made it clear he and I can no longer communicate. XXXX or not XXXX is guilty of this fraud, it 's hard for me to believe he has no liability in this matter whatsoever. Not once did he have verbal communication with me to confirm complete, safe preparation for closing. 

Since he claimed he did not send this email, I inquired as to what he DID send, otherwise I would not have known how to be prepared for closing. He claimed he sent an email XXXX/XXXX/15 ( the day right before XXXX ; closing was the immediate Monday after ) that stated specifics on what to bring to closing ; I never received this email. Upon wanting to see proof of this email, he was only able to send a PDF copy of it, claiming he deletes proof of sent, but prints them instead. This alone makes no sense. To top it all off, my email address on this particular email was ALL OF A SUDDEN incorrect. So, even if he DID send it like he claims, I would n't have received it anyway, and even if WERE accurately sent, it would 've been too late. This is unacceptable. 

I 'm out {$35000.00} and am desperately trying to recover these hard-earned funds. I 've filed a police report and hired an attorney but honestly feel the CFPB should be involved in this as well. There should be a serious warning to all homebuyers to ensure this does not happen again. Upon searching online, I see this scam has been going on for years ; with that said, I would think banks, realtors and closing attorneys would be precautious. This could 've easily been prevented. Please help recover my hard-earned funds.

This issue has already been ongoing since XXXX XXXX or so of 2015. 
I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I made a payment to elance.com website for a service. Within my own paypal account, my friend and I added her credit card to the account a few months prior so we could order a new cell phone replacement screen on Ebay. Her card was not the "" PRIMARY '' card on the account, my own was. So when I placed a {$290.00} payment to elance.com, paypal used my friends credit card instead of the available XXXX in my bank account. Which was their mistake and problem they caused for my friends bank who put her into a negative balance and then charged her {$33.00} for every few days the issue went on. PayPal refused to "" refund '' the friends card, and debit my account. Claiming that I had to pay that person myself, with cash. So I did so just so the friend was not out {$320.00} and was charged another overdraft fee. 
XXXX later refunded my payment, which is the natural course of action when the other party does not pay for their cost of the arbitration filing. So now that my XXXX was refunded to paypal, paypal locked my account and refuses to allow me to remove my funds. 

Aside from filing a law suit in court, I am going to try this fist.

He was then able to transfer the funds from his personal PayPal account to his business PayPal account. He then attempted, again, to transfer the funds to his XXXX so he could access the money. But now is being denied access to the funds because the business PayPal account is frozen. This is because PayPal requires my relative to provide detailed business information needed to complete the business account, which he can not do, because he has no business! Thus, the {$2000.00} can not be accessed by anyone as long as PayPal has his business account frozen. Note that the only money in his business PayPal account is the {$2000.00} I sent him. The only reason for setting up the business account was due to problems with his personal PayPal account. When I tried to submit a dispute via PayPal resolution center, they stated that I had to contact the seller directly for a refund. With his account frozen for administrative reasons only, no one can touch the money. My relative would be very happy to send the money back to me, if only PayPal would let him.

I was told the Rightful Owner of the cosmetic line, XXXX, had reported me. One day after I reached out to XXXX asking them to cease and desist from discriminating against me, Paypal Permanently Limited All Access to my Account and are now holding almost {$500.00} of my money for 180 days. I tried to appeal their action and my appeal was denied. Clearly, XXXX and Paypal conspired to ostensibly put me out of business. I never represented the product I was selling was an authentic XXXX product as hundreds of other eBay sellers have. In fact, most recently I began to include the following language in my listings : "" I am not affiliated with or endorsed by the company mentioned in this listing. All trademarks and copyrights are acknowledged, they are only used for informative description of the items offered for sale. '' I have ceased selling any products even remotely related to XXXX, and I will never sell such products again. I do n't understand why XXXX has singled me out and Paypal has agreed to work along with them ; I am a very small seller. I 've sold probably less than XXXX of these items. I am attaching a list of random eBay sellers showing the magnitude of fake XXXX products freely being sold on eBay without interference or restraint. I thought it was okay ; everyone else was doing it. I am retired, almost XXXX years old and just trying to make a few dollars to supplement my social security. There are hundreds of other volume sellers on eBay selling this very same product. Instead of going after them, they have decided, instead to go after me. I do n't know what they expect to get out of this. I have nothing. Their actions are now beginning to affect my health. What they are doing is unconscionable. 
Two weeks ago while I was gathering up my records for income tax purposes, I noticed Paypal had been commingling the funds from my two separate operations. When I called them on it, they refused to separate the account. Most of the funds currently on deposit in the first frozen account were generated from the non-violating business operation. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I filed a complaint with both the California and the Nebraska Attorney General 's office against Paypal for illegally holding my money. 
In the meanwhile and on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I opened a new Paypal account for the second operation. Everything was fine until yesterday morning when I discovered that new account has also been Permanently Limited. There is almost {$90.00} in that XXXX new account. Their reason for permanently limiting my new account is that I sell XXXX products -- XXXX. I have been selling these products for almost a year now without a problem or interference from either eBay or Paypal. In reviewing both Paypal 's User Agreement and their Acceptable Use Policy I find that neither contains any language prohibiting the sale of vaping products. The Acceptable Use Agreement does contain language to the effect that approval must be given for the sale of XXXX. Paypal was fully aware of the products I was selling and willingly levied and collected fees on hundreds and hundreds of transactions generated solely from the sale of vaping products. Their action constitute an implied approval of my sales and negates their present reason for permanently limiting my XXXX account. Clearly, Paypal 's current actions are in direct retaliation to the Complaints I filed against them. They are unscrupulous and unethical, and they must be stopped! I want my money released immediately.

Upon opening my new US account, I was told that because I was a new customer, a hold would be placed on any balance over {$1000.00}, because I was a new customer. I had not been informed of this on opening an account, only when I tried to withdraw my balance for the first time. Because I run my business through PayPal, this was a considerable inconvenience, so I called to find out what was going on. It took me several long and expensive phone calls before anyone would tell me why I could not withdraw my balance. I was told that the limit on my account was because I was a new customer, but no one could tell me how long I would be considered a new customer for, when the limit could be lifted, how often the account status would be reviewed, or where I could get more information. After struggling with this issue for several months, losing considerable business along the way, PayPal pressured me into opening a business account as a way around the issue of the limit. Since then, i have had issues claiming and withdrawing payments made to me in XXXX. When I have phoned PayPal for assistance, I have been told that there are technical issues, but no one can tell me when they will be resolved and how soon I will be able to access my funds. I am always placed on hold for at least 30 minutes, and all of the phone calls above have lasted over an hour - not only is this very expensive, but I never get any help from the phone-calls anyway, making them a waste of time and money. The representatives I speak to refuse to give me information on how I can make a complaint, and frequently attempt to get me off of the phone before my problem is resolved. I have since learned that PayPal is being sued for issued relating to illegal holds on funds as described above, but sadly my issued occurred after the period of the claims - suggesting that PayPal is continuing these illegal practices in spite of the previous complaints and actions. If I did not depend on PayPal to run my business, I would want nothing more to do with them - but I sadly do n't have that option. I would, however, like PayPal to be made to recompense me for the poor service, inconvenience, lack of customer support and information, time-consuming and expensive fruitless customer service calls, and damage to my business over several months.

I have XXXX bank accounts listed on my PayPal account. The first account we will call "" Default Account ''. 
I authorized a transaction but I wanted to pay out of my new account, we will call it "" Account XXXX '' for now. I selected "" Account XXXX '' at checkout. The screen said "" Your payment type has been changed '' indicating that I was now paying out of "" Account XXXX '' instead of the "" Default Account. '' A day later I noticed that PayPal had instead withdrawn money out of my "" Default Account. '' I was upset because this cause the "" Default Account '' to overdraft, resulting in a {$32.00} NSF fee. At this time I took no action because I had no proof that PayPal had made the error. I wondered if maybe I was mistaken and had forgotten to update the account settings, although that seemed unlikely. I let it go. 
A couple days later I tried to do the same thing. I made a purchase and chose "" Account XXXX ''. The checkout screen gave a message that I had correctly updated my account choice. Again. I was confident I had done this correctly and went ahead with the transaction. 
One day later I called the company I was purchasing from to make a change in the product. They had to refund and recharge the same account to make the change. I was fine with this since I KNEW I had selected "" Account XXXX '' A couple days later both transactions went through my "" Default account '' instead of "" Account XXXX ''. I was XXXX % sure I had chosen "" Account XXXX '' during checkout and yet PayPal reverted the transaction back to my "" XXXX Account. '' I now have a total of {$96.00} in NSF fees because PayPal is selecting the "" Default Account '' every time instead of updating to the account that the consumer selects. 
Over the next week that company kept retrying the PayPal default and eventually I had a fourth NSF fee. I was powerless to stop this. I now have {$120.00} in NSF fees, all because PayPal chose the wrong account. I only authorized "" Account XXXX '' and never authorized the "" Default Account. '' I called and asked PayPal to refund the NSF fees and they refuse. They refuse to even admit that their system is causing this error. I asked them why they allow XXXX accounts on file if they ALWAYS choose the default account but they wo n't answer because they do n't want to admit fault. 
I know PayPal wont admit to their error but at this point it is BEYOND the {$120.00}. I know this must be happening to other people ... eventually there will probably be some kind of a class action lawsuit. But in the meantime PayPal is ripping people off and refusing to fix their mistake.

On XXXX XXXX, PayPal decided to manually overview my account and believed it was best to finalize my partnership. This was due to a possible violation which may have happened on my account. The permanent restriction was placed on my account causing {$1000.00} to be held at my expense. 

The concern was that I was believed to infringe the rights of copyright holders when processing my sales with PayPal. After contacting agents to overlook the decision by phone and email, my request was denied. 

The reason being is that the items I sell are not fake. They are legally obtained through liquidations. I have been selling for over 5 years now, never having a problem with any brand owners regarding copyright infringement. We have now started drop shipping from our exporter for Almost two years with PayPal, coming to around XXXX satisfied eBay customers due to our exporters expertise in shipping within handling time, while providing items that are known for there authenticity.

04/29/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Money was not available when promised,,"Below is the email complaint I submitted to MoneyGram 's Online Complaint Page ... 
Today was my XXXX and XXXX time using MoneyGram. I received the absolute worse, most harrowing service that I have ever experienced in my life. At XXXX XXXX I completed a cash transaction with MoneyGram for {$6000.00} + {$120.00} in transfer fees, and {$7.00} in transfer taxes. I was wiring money to my son 's father in South Carolina. Last XXXX, I was in a car wreck that totaled my vehicle. My son 's father was helping me with the purchase of another vehicle, so getting the money to him was urgent. Let me pause to say, I resent even having to explain why I was using your service as it is a violation of my privacy and I am paying you handsomely to provide the service. In any case, I paid for your service which promised that my receiver would be able to pick the funds up within 10 minutes. That did not happen. Instead he was told that there was a hold on the transaction and the folk at his South Carolina XXXX location told him to tell me I would have to ride back up to XXXX to resolve the issue. I returned to XXXX ( a huge inconvenience ) with all my paperwork showing that I 'd paid for the service and sent the money and it was confirmed that there was a hold. I was told I needed to speak with a MoneyGram agent who needed to ask me some questions. Needless to say, I 'm heated at this point. I 've paid for a service I did n't receive. Now, I need to be questioned about why I am sending the money, my relationship to the person to whom I am sending it, and what the money will be used for. At XXXX I refused to be forthcoming with that information as it was no one 's business. Frankly, if MoneyGram was truly concerned about these issues they would have asked these questions on the front end, before they took my cold-hard cash, processed the transaction, gave me a receipt indicating that the service I purchased would be provided. Instead, MoneyGram took the cash then proceeded to treat me like a suspect in some sort of scam operation all the while holding my funds hostage. Furthermore, every MoneyGram associate I spoke with was patronizing and condescending. XXXX so called supervisor even hung up on me! When the XXXX associate called back to advocate on my behalf the original MoneyGram agent who gave us the name XXXX ( Operator # XXXX ), hung up on her. Finally, a XXXX Manager got involved and a MoneyGram agent hung up on her too. I am absolutely appalled! The hold on my transaction was not released until an hour and a half after I had paid for the XXXX minute service. In between, I was treated horribly and inconveniently by every MoneyGram agent with whom I spoke and I PAID for YOUR SERVICE, {$120.00}. When I flat out asked the agent -- she gave the name XXXX -- if there was anything MoneyGram was willing to do to make-up for the way in which I had been treated and inconvenienced, she said, "" Absolutely not, '' and ... "" Yes, that 's what I 'm telling you ... '' [ In response to my question, so you all are n't going to do anything? ] I ca n't believe a company as well-known as yours treats their customers this awful. Frankly, given the humiliation I was forced to endure and the long delay ( one and a half-hour ) instead of the XXXX minutes I paid for, I feel strongly that I should be reimbursed the {$120.00}, as I did not receive the service I paid for. When I asked the agent XXXX if they do this to all of their customers he responded, "" No, just when it 's suspicious. '' I 'm a XXXX woman. I was sending the money to my son 's father a XXXX XXXX with the clearly XXXX name XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I ca n't help but wonder if my own telling "" XXXX XXXX accented '' XXXX and XXXX 's name were "" suspicious.

05/22/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other service issues,,"My privacy has been violated by Wal-Mart, and their agents, Ria Financial. 
I am a regular working person, not a lawyer, activist or an advocate of any kind. I do OK in my chosen profession financially, which has allowed me to pay my required alimony and child support to my ex-wife, and to help various friends out when they need it. Some do not have cars or bank accounts, so I have been sending them money to pay their bills, buy food and medicine and such via Wal-Mart Store-To-Store money transfer. It is convenient, low-cost and easily accessible for them. Wal-Mart uses a company, Ria Money Transfer, which is a subsidiary of the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I send the first half of my twice-monthly alimony and child support payments to my ex-wife, {$900.00}, which is the maximum you can send in a 24 hour period. I was required to show identification, which I gladly did, and sent her the money. The next day, I was planning to send XXXX of friend 's money, {$40.00} and {$300.00} respectively, so that they could get through the month. Both are unemployed, and only XXXX has any income at all ( SSI ) but it does n't cover her medicine costs for the month. They count on me to help, and I am glad I can. 
So after sending the {$900.00} to my ex-wife, I received a call from the Compliance Department of Ria Financial. The person I spoke with, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) informed me that my current transfer was blocked, and so were all future money transfers. This is after they had already taken out the {$900.00} from my bank account. I make good money, but {$900.00} is a substantial sum to me. And even more worrying, my ex-wife would be unable to make her mortgage payment. Also, I had people counting on me to send them money the next day. I asked why, and I was told that I had sent more than {$20000.00} in a calendar year, and they demanded that I fill out a form asking all kinds of personal and financial information, the name and address of my employer, send them a copy of my driver 's license and passport, and a copy of my most recent paystub. If I did not supply the demanded information, they would not release the {$900.00} I had already transferred, and ban me from sending any more money through Wal-Mart. 
As I have said, I have people I care about depending on me, and I was, I will admit, frankly enraged. I demanded to know why I was being treated like a criminal. I had done nothing wrong or broken any laws or regulations that I know of. The representative of Ria Financial again demanded that I supply the information or else they would not release the {$900.00} or allow me to do any future transfers. I have people depending on me. This was now a hostage situation, and I had no choice but to comply. I emailed them the completed form a scan of my driver 's license and passport, and my paystub of XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
Being forced to disclose this information and supply documents like a copy of my ID 's and paystub is just wrong. It is also a clear violation of my rights as a consumer under GLBA. It has also caused me a great deal of distress and worry. I ca n't close my bank account right now, and now someone somewhere in the world knows everything there is to know about me, and there is nothing I can do about it. 
No one should have to live with the stress of what I currently live with, knowing that at any time my personal and financial information is subject to compromise. 
My rights as a consumer under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act have been violated, and I have nowhere to go to about this, which is why I am turning to you.

I returned to the branch where a wire investigation form was filled out and faxed to the wire transfer department to send to the recipient 's bank. On XXXX I find out, quite accidentally, that my checking account has been frozen by Webster Bank without my knowledge. I am told that this was done because they suspected fraud. My account was unfrozen, but on XX/XX/2015, when the money had still not reached its destination, I returned to the branch to find out that the fax to the wire department had never gone through on XXXX because their fax machine was out of order, and still not repaired on XX/XX/XXXX!

The seller was located in XXXX and offered free shipping ( see attached ). This free shipping and the entire transaction was based on false and misleading advertising. The seller knew that the item, even though advertised ( see attached ) to fit the style ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) of my vehicle, did not fit and an unsuspecting buyer would be forced to send it back to XXXX and eventually end up paying for shipping. 

The item is too long for the trunk of my XXXX MB. When I contacted the seller, "" XXXX '' stated that I should return the item but she was unable to provide a prepaid return label from XXXX. Although she mailed the item via XXXX ( # XXXX ), the seller also stated that "" there is no local shipping address within United States, that 's why we ca n't offer pre-paid service due to we are not located in USA '' ( see attached ).

When I called, the woman on the phone said that a yellow notice had been put on my door on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and that I had 19 days to respond. When I said I did n't get a notice on my door, she asked if I was calling her a liar and she said she had a picture of my house with the notice attached to my door.

By then I thought I was going to lose it. She then said, that there was XXXX option she could offer me and would give me time and the arrest warrant could be stopped. She told me that I owed approximately {$4900.00} to the IRS. She said the time was ticking and that I needed to move fast. She had me go withdraw {$5000.00} in cash from my bank. She stayed on the line because she said she needed to give me further directions. She then asked me to go to the Wells Fargo Bank and make a deposit to a certain account number and gave me the name of the person it was going to. She said that if I was asked why I was sending this large amount, to say I was helping a sick friend. I ask why and she said that banks have to put a freeze on all my assets if they get the feeling that I was in trouble with the IRS. She had me deposit {$3000.00} that time. Then I was directed to get back in my car and she would give me further instructions. This time she told me to go back into the bank and deposit the other {$2000.00} to a different account number. She told me to go to a different teller so it wouldn ; 't look suspicious and to keep her on speaker phone. She said that was the only way that she could assure me to keep me out of jail and out of court. She then asked me to go to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX in XXXX, VA and have then email a copy of the XXXX receipts to XXXXXXXXXXXX. I told her I did n't know where that was so she instructed me to go to XXXX XXXX and have them email it.

08/13/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Wrong amount charged or received,,"I am filing this complaint regarding Pay Pal. 
The fees they charge for a seller on ebay are not transparent. They are hidden, and difficult to find. For the casual individual selling something on Ebay, it is very tricky. 

1. When you receive payment from a buyer through Pay Pal, you receive an email from Pay Pal saying that you received a payment of, for example {$100.00} from a particular buyer. There is no mention of fees being taken out by PayPal. If you go to your Pay Pal account ( using the Pay Pal phone application ) there is no reference at all to fees anywhere on the site. When you look at your personal activity ledger, it will show, for example for the fictional transaction above, that your account was credited approximately {$97.00}. There is no reference, even in the details of the transaction report, to the 2.9 % plus {$0.00} in fees that Pay Pal removes from what the buyer paid. The smaller amount just shows up in your account. This seems to me obviously designed to make it difficult to see the fees, and to make it likely that many people will overlook the fact that fees are being taken out of the account. If you just go by the emails you receive from PayPal, you will one day look at your account and find significantly less money than you expected. Pay Pal should be required to show the fees they are taking in the emails and phone application account activity. Anything less is deceptive and misleading. 

2. The PayPal website is better on this, but only slightly. If you go to the Pay Pal website, and have not signed in, then if you scroll to the very bottom of the page, you will see a small word "" fees. '' If you click on that you get information on seller fees. However, once you log in to the pay pal site -- which most people do immediately and automatically -- then the fees information disappears!! In other words, once you log in, you can not get information on fees!! Obviously designed to hide information from Pay Pal users. 
On the website, in your one 's personal account, you see nothing about fees in the listing of transactions. Only when you click on the details of an individual account do you see the actual calculation : the money sent by the buyer, and the amount extracted by Pay Pal. 

The above represents classic tactics to hide the amount and taking of fees from Pay Pal users. Obviously, the intrepid and careful user ( who does n't log in ) can find the information. But Pay Pal has designed its system to hide this information from the user who uses Pay Pal 's phone application ( no information about fees at all, and misleading account information ), and even on the Pay Pal website the fees are unnecessarily hidden. Pay Pal is a huge company. With millions of users, they are able to make quite a bit of money out of these deceptive practices. This is wrong.

I have perfect feedback on both sites and many many returning thrilled customers, dedicating my life to making my customers happy.

During this review period Ebay also closed my store because of their rule that all sellers must have a Paypal account in good standing and Paypal is the only method of payment sellers are allowed to use. After about 2-3 weeks of worry, phone calls and much travail I received an email from Paypal stating that they had decided to reinstate my account but that they would now withhold 25 % of all of my incoming funds for a period of 4 months ( a 'rolling reserve ' ) starting immediately ( no warning whatsoever ). They said this is due to a number of reasons, XXXX of which being that my credit score was below XXXX etc., etc. and that I had a high percentage of chargebacks ( I believe I have had less than XXXX in the last 12 months- XXXX of which were no fault of mine whatsoever ), blah blah blah.

Please help. There are also many others out there like myself, I am by far not the only XXXX.

Transfast debited my bank account for {$3300.00} on XXXX and till XXXX i.e. even after the XXXX there was no communication from them. 
Finally on XXXX @ XXXX PST i.e. Thu night, an analyst ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) sends a mail asking for additional documents like US ID, passport etc. to complete the transfer. It was frustrating to realize that my money is still not begun its journey and almost after a week Transfast is asking for additional documents. I decided not to do business with this company because even if I send the documents, I will get the money only after XXXX i.e. next Monday. Therefore I informed Ivee to cancel this transaction ( XXXX ) and send me the refund. She asked me to write a mail to XXXXXXXXXXXX which I did on XXXX @ XXXX XXXX and requested them to call me and provide eta of my refund.

Also since XXXX is XXXX hrs ahead of US time their day will be over before US starts work. 
To avoid this situation I had to borrow this money from my friend in XXXX and will return him back when I get my money. 

Therefore next day i.e. today morning ( XXXX ) I called Transfast helpline no. XXXX and on first attempt I waited for XXXX minutes on call since I was XXXX in line and when my turn came, before someone could talk to my line got disconnected.

Why my account was debited first if there was problem with my documents. XXXX informed me that it will 3 to 5 business days to get my money ( i.e. XXXX to XXXX ) and that money was debited because their ACH team does that process irrespective of the fact whether customer has provided the documents or not. Thereafter I spoke to XXXX the customer center manager but she was adamant not to listen my problem, but insisting me to wait and follow the process. I think the Transfast process has BIG FLAW and they are using customers money and making huge profits because of currency fluctuations of dollar vs XXXX. 
I request CFPB to look at my case and penalize Transfast as much as possible. 

My complaint against Transfast.com is to compensate me for this embarrassing situation and return my money asap. Because they should have -1. Not accepted my request if they wanted more documents2. Not taken money from bank account if I was not compliant as per their policy3. Informed me on XXXX or XXXX itself that I am not compliant to transfer moneyKindly help.

Unfortunately, the customer wanted to pay via credit card, so I used PayPal to process the transaction. The payment cleared, but PayPal is holding the funds for up to 21 days. Not to mention the fact that they take an additional 3 to 5 business days to transfer money to my real bank. I called and spoke with a PayPal customer service representative as well as a "" specialist ''. Both reps were nice, and tried to be helpful, but the earliest they are willing to release my funds is by next Thursday, XXXX XXXX. This is amount of time is ridiculous. I understand that PayPal needs to earn interest on my money, and the longer they hold my funds, the more interest they make. The longer they hold the funds, the greater number of bills that I have are going past due. My credit rating is being destroyed while PayPal makes money. And I paid them nearly {$100.00} to process the credit card transaction. And I 'll have to pay to transfer the money to my bank account. 

Most people agree that electronic commerce is nearly instantaneous - why is it necessary for companies to withhold funds for ridiculous lengths of time? I 'm being punished for doing my part, providing a quality service, and delivering on time, only to have PayPal not release my funds until it is very convenient for them.

10/25/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"I have a checking, savings, and mortgage loan through BBVA Compass Bank. I acquired the loan XX/XX/XXXX and up until the past year had not had any issues. However, on XX/XX/XXXX I received notice that my mortgage payment due on XX/XX/XXXX had not been paid when I in fact had made payment via money transfer from my checking to my mortgage account. Compass customer service recognized that the transfer was attempted in XXXX prior to its due date, but was not effective for some unknown reason. The issue was resolved. 
Once again on XXXX the same issue arose. I was notified of non payment of my mortgage when I in fact had paid via online account transfers. I was told my reference code given at time of payment was not valid proof that payment had been made/attempted, and that the confirmation code given at time of payment was not valid proof the payment was successful. I made an over the phone payment to resolve the debit and I was told for future reference to check the payment had been deducted from my checking account 3-5 business days following my online transfer. This to me seemed excessive, giving that I was merely attempting to transfer funds between a checking account and a mortgage account within the same banking system. I decided the easiest way to assure timely payments were made to the mortgage loan was to set up automatic transfers from the checking to the mortgage account. I authorized 6 monthly transfers to occur on the XXXX of each month. When I logged on to my online account profile 3 business days later XX/XX/XXXX I was shocked to see my checking, savings, and mortgage account balances all displayed as {$0.00}. I quickly contacted customer service and was assured this was a mere online banking system glitch and my accounts were in fact intact. 
The next few months went by and all seemed well with payments automatically transferring in a timely manner XXXX. Then on XXXX I once again received notice that my mortgage account was delinquent for non payment. I logged in to my online banking account and noticed my profile was incorrect. I could no longer access or view my mortgage account ; it seemed to be non existent. Further more, there was no record of the automatic transfers I had authorized. I once again called customer service multiple times and was given the run-around, hung up on, and was being transferred from XXXX department to the next. No one could seem to answer my questions as to why I was not able to view my mortgage account or resolve my issue. I was told everything was fine and I just needed to make payment and would be charged a late fee for non payment. I refused to pay a late fee due to the fact that the payment should have been made via the automatic transfer between the XXXX accounts within their system. I have yet been able to resolve this issue and currently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) am still unable to view my mortgage account online to assure the payment I made over the phone with a customer service representative was even successful. I do not feel comfortable with the fact that I do not have access to view or manage my mortgage account at my convenience. I can not monitor payments that I make, nor view funds being disbursed. I can not confirm the remaining automatic transfers are still valid.

12/18/2015,Money transfers,International money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"I have a complaint against Western Union. I had made several transactions to XXXX before someone from Western decided to let me know that that area had been deemed a known area for scams. On XXXX XXXX I had made several transactions to XXXX XXXX XXXX for the purchase of a puppy I thought I had bought from a XXXX XXXX XXXX from Virginia. The transactions I had made this day totaled {$1400.00}. It was n't until Monday XXXX XXXX when I went to make another transaction that a Western Union employee stopped the transaction and took some information from me and told me that this was a flagged area for scams. At that time I was reimbursed my money in the sum of {$2200.00}. I was the stupid one after that and the individual convinced myself and my mother that the puppy was coming and that they needed the money. So we decided to send the last {$2200.00} anyway. 
I did file a police report because I would like to at least recoup the money I sent prior to being warned about the scam area. 
I want to share this with the world because this is a scam that pertains to the selling and shipping of puppies. Looking on the internet under what I thought were legitimate sites ( XXXX. ) I thought I was purchasing a XXXX puppy from a man in VA, by the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for {$450.00}. He sent me paperwork for change in ownership and everything. He said that he was going to ship the dog and that I should receive him in a day or so and that the shipping company would be contacting me. I did n't think about it at the time but he insisted that I send the money through XXXX. The money went to VA so I thought everything was good. 
Well the shipping company ( under the logo of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX ) contacted me the next day to tell me that they needed {$1200.00} to provide a crate for the puppy and insurance, which would all be refunded once the puppy arrived. I in turned called the seller back and asked him if this was legit and he assured me it was, me not thinking he was in on the entire scam, I sent the money using my Debit card through XXXX and sent it Western Union. I did find it odd at the time that I was sending it to XXXX, but I figured since it was an international company that may be normal. 
Well the next day the shipping company kept calling and for some reason the puppy could never get on the flight coming to FL. Then Sunday they called stating that they needed another {$2200.00} for the USDA certificate and license so that the puppy could come to the state of FL and that the puppy had to go through customs. I kept telling him the puppy only came from VA why was he going through customs. He being of XXXX nationality kept saying it was part of their process. I reluctantly paid the {$2200.00} because the dog was for my mom who really wanted a XXXX and I really wanted her to have XXXX. She has XXXX XXXX and she 's on XXXX so she does n't get to leave the house very often and she wanted a companion and I thought this would make her happy and I wanted to give it to her for XXXX. It was this day reality slapped me hard in the face. Western Union had flagged XXXX and they told me that this was a scam. I was so convinced that these individuals were being honest with me that I did not listen even after Western Union gave me the {$2200.00} back. I still sent it, {$1100.00}, {$1100.00}, because I just did n't want to see the truth. But like I said reality slapped me hard in the face. 
All I want is the {$1400.00} back from Western Union because if they knew it was a area known for scams, they should not allow anyone to transfer to that area.

02/05/2016,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"( GW stands for Google Wallet ) I am missing {$200.00} from a $ movement transaction w/ GW . I attempted to get this resolved through the XXXX however my complaint was closed down and referred to as "" Answered - the business addressed the issues within the complaint, but the consumer remains dissatisfied. '' My issue has n't been addressed so I decided to reach out via another source. 
On XXXX XXXX I requested {$500.00} in the form of XXXX {$200.00} & XXXX {$100.00} separate requests to be sent from my ckg to GW. GW indicated the $ would be available on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, my bank stmt indicated {$700.00} in the form of XXXX {$200.00} & XXXX {$100.00} separate requests were sent to GW instead of {$500.00}. I contacted my bank and they refunded my unauthor. {$200.00} from GW. On XXXX XXXX {$500.00} as author. by me was available at GW. On this same day my GW acct was suspended due to suspicious activity. This was resolved the same day via showing my license and documentation with my address on it. However, the following day, {$200.00} out of my {$500.00} with GW was "" refunded back '' to my ckg acct. I have an email from GW ( attached ) indicating such. I noticed on this same day that my ckg acct that was linked to GW was no longer attached. I have yet to receive the {$200.00} that GW sent back to my ckg acct. Since XXXX XXXX I have been trying to seek resolution. I have been told that this was a chargeback to my ckg acct therefore the money was refunded by my bank and I have also been told that it was a refund which should arrive to my ckg acct within 10 to 12 business days.When my bank instructed me to verify my ckg acct info with GW, I am told by GW that they are unable to do so and all they could give me was a GW transaction number that holds no use at my bank. I have attempted to explain that the {$200.00} my bank refunded for me is not the same {$200.00} that GW considers a chargeback. I believe GW has confused the transactions and are treating them the same although they were to be treated as XXXX separate transactions. What I believe has happened is that the extra {$200.00} that was taken out of my ckg acct was rerouted by someone who was fraudulently gaining funds from my Google Wallet. If this happened and GW did not receive the additional {$200.00}, because my bank demanded the additional {$200.00} back, GW gave {$200.00} from my authorized funds as a way to resolve the bank demand. When discussing this issue with my bank they indicated that GW was not safe to use due to how easy it is for people to access your GW acct to steal money. My concerns have apparently been escalated to 2 supervisors named XXXX and XXXX as well as "" higher operations '' and I have n't received any updates or resolutions since XXXX XXXX through GW 's customer service system. 

Since the complaint at XXXX, I have shared my bank statement ( attached ) showing the XXXX {$200.00} transactions and XXXX {$100.00} transactions as well as the recovery of XXXX {$200.00} transaction by my bank. GW has also indicated that in their system they showed XXXX {$200.00} transactions on XXXX however their system rejected XXXX {$200.00} payment and it went back to the source, my ckg acct. I explained to them that this was n't the case because if XXXX {$200.00} transaction came back to my ckg, then I would have only had {$300.00} in my GW acct on XXXX. If I would have had {$300.00} in with GW, I would not have been able to make {$280.00} in transactions from XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX AND have GW "" chargeback '' {$200.00} of the funds. I would have been in the negative, so clearly XXXX {$200.00} and XXXX {$100.00} came through on XXXX and was avail. on XXXX XXXX as authorized. Perhaps the {$200.00} that the GW system rejected rerouted the $ to the wrong acct. Last GW and I left off they wanted me to reopen a case #, follow up on their system so it can be pushed to billing and payments for further investigation. I do n't feel confident to allow them to handle it solely through their customer service system. I have tried that and have n't heard anything since XXXX XXXX.

On XXXX XXXX, I received the transaction bill of {$500.00} at an exchange rate of XXXX USD = XXXX XXXX. Plus I would pay {$5.00} for the service. So a total of {$500.00} and my sister-in-law would receive XXXX XXXX. She needed this money by Saturday. I have used this service three or four times in the past. The first two times there were problems with the recipient 's name appearing properly but the last time there were no problems. 

I submitted my payment through my online banking to pay on XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my money was withdrawn. Western Union emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX claiming that the money had not been received. So I contacted my bank 's customer service and they said sometimes it takes twenty-four hours to be released. So I called Western Union again on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, they claimed again the money was not received. I called my bank again and the customer service representative said I would need to speak directly with the Automatic Clearing House ( ACH ) department which processes these transactions but they are closed on the weekends. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX 's ACH department. They confirmed the payment had been made on XXXX XXXX and gave me the original trace id of the transaction ( XXXX ). The representative also gave me Western Union 's bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their ACH department number and said I could call them and confirm it was received and placed in the correct account. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and they did indeed confirm that the money was received on XX/XX/XXXX and deposited into Western Union 's account ( XXXX ) along with my account number XXXX. 

Still on XX/XX/XXXX, now that I felt I had proof that they had received the money, I called Western Union again. Unfortunately, I did not get this representative 's name. She tried to claim yet again the money was n't received. I insisted it had been and gave her the original trace id for the ACH transaction. She said she would ask her supervisor to resolve the problem. I also submitted a complaint to their complaint dept at XXXXXXXXXXXX. 

I called on XX/XX/XXXX to check the status. This representative tried to claim yet again that they had not received the money. When I insisted that I had proof it was received he put me on hold to check the account and he came back and said it had been confirmed that the money arrived and my receipt should be able to withdrawn today or tomorrow. 

I told my sister-in-law she could withdraw the money. Because of her work schedule, she did n't have an opportunity to do this until the morning of Friday XXXX XXXX. When she tried to get the money she was told it still had n't been sent. 

So still XX/XX/XXXX., I called Western Union and spoke to XXXX employee id XXXX. He tried to again say the money was n't received. I kept insisting and finally asked for his supervisor, XXXX employee id XXXX. XXXX said I needed to submit the original trace number to the bank transfer department and he gave me the following email address : XXXXXXXXXXXX. I emailed that department and also the customer advocate department again since I had n't had a response from them. 

Currently it is XXXX XXXX and I received a response finally from the complaint department saying my payment of {$220.00} was received. Since the company has been almost totally unresponsive to my attempts to fix this problem I am submitting this complaint.

I pay {$50.00} a month for this privilege. HSBC links my XXXX accounts and the transfers are supposed to be immediate. 
After having done this without problem for 5 years ( the funds would exit my XXXX account and be credited immediately to my XXXX account ), on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I tried to transfer {$1900.00} and the funds never got to XXXX. It took at east 20 calls to the HSBC XXXX call center and the XXXX call center.

I spent a total of at least 30 hours on the phone trying to find out why my money got lost XXXX I explained that I needed the money MOST URGENTLY to cover expenses in XXXX as a retiree. Nothing swayed the call center staff into action. 
Finally, after much begging, my problem was "" escalated '' to a "" technical team '' and I was told I would get an answer in 48 hours ( which turned out to be 48 WORKING hours, or 6 days ). The reply I got from the XXXX HSBC XXXX team was, quote : "" We have no access to the XXXX systems, and therefore we are unable to ascertain whether there was a transfer ''. The call center employee who read me that incredible reply over the phone suggested sending an e-mail to the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, if I wished to pursue the matter further. 
I called the XXXX call center once again ( it was around XXXX XXXX by then ) and they discussed the matter with XXXX. They were able to determine that the money had gone into a so-called "" Transfer Suspense Account '' due to a technical glitch on their side. 
By then I was REALLY short of money in XXXX so I had to return to the XXXX to access funds. Once XXXX, I continued to pursue my case and finally, XXXX of the countless XXXX call center employees who I had discussed it with called me back and promised I would get my {$1900.00} back in my XXXX account. Incidentally, every time you call the HSBC XXXX center you have to answer a long list of security questions to make sure you are the account holder. However, the customer service people are not allowed to provide any information on themselves.

Why does HSBC offer a "" XXXX '' service to its best clients and then does nothing to satisfy their needs, even if they are pressing as in my case? 
I heard that HSBC had to pay a hefty fine for laundering funds for XXXX recently. Could it be that their XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX is too busy doing that type of transaction to care about a meager {$1900.00} transferred by a lowly XXXX expatriate who needs the money to live on?

Very little money for my father 's birthday and they made a big deal to take away my precious time to solve their problems because they are incompetent.

I can not believe that between the bank and Western Union, no one could use the brain to go an extra mile to solve the problem. I 'm here in NY and solved the problem for these XXXX incompetent institutions. First WU sent a confirmation email saying my father can pickup the money ( strike one! ).

If WU could not release the money, they should have sent a very specific email stating they need a copy of my father 's ID for their future record so they will not release the money to a wrong person, so we all can solve the issue before my father 's trip to the bank, not after. This should have been stated clearly! Then my father took not 1 but more than a trip to the bank, 3 days in a row ( strike two! ). They still could n't figure out how to solve the issue. Then they got me involved ( strike three! ). With a high-tech going around, I asked my sister ( who lives in the XXXX country ) to take a photo of my father 's ID and send it to me. Between my sister and myself, we solved the problem and we always do. I then sent the email to WU staff member and request with a firm instruction to release the money immediately.

So OK, security check, I get it. But not to communicate with me is a wrong strategy ; I am the sender.

After waiting a few additional days to see if the remainder of my items would arrive, I tried to contact the seller through the XXXX website help function ; however, the chat/help function was broken every time I attempted to use it, which occurred on multiple days during different times of day. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I initiated a dispute with PayPal. The seller offered a refund of about {$24.00}, which I rejected and escalated the dispute to a claim on XXXX XXXX, 2015 with PayPal. PayPal rejected the claim on XXXX XXXX, stating that I did not provide documentation in a timely manner. However, during the time between claim escalation and closure, PayPal never requested any further documentation and the status on the website was that it was continuing to review the claim. Then the claim was abruptly closed. I followed up with PayPal to try to re-open the claim so I could provide photographs of the items, but their policy is to not re-open a claim after it has been closed. The seller then unilaterally issued me a refund of {$2.00}, which I tried to reject, but was unable to do so. 

Throughout I had tried to email the seller, and after the claim was closed I sent another email that included a letter from myself as an attorney, explaining applicable Virginia contracts and sales law and requesting a full refund and a pre-paid shipping label. I never received a response to these communications. There was no mailing address for the seller so I could not mail a physical copy of the letter, but did email it to both email addresses provided on PayPal for the seller. 

I would appreciate any assistance in this matter. I simply would like to return the damaged and non-conforming items to the seller for a full refund, including the seller paying for return shipping costs.

PayPal closed my dispute without resolution and by making deceptive statements. I never was able to claim my money that was transferred which is the root of this complaint. PayPal called me once on a Saturday and left me a message. I was not able to retrieve the voicemail until the following week upon which I learned PayPal closed my dispute via snail mail two days after the left me a voicemail. They never emailed me ( my preferred method of contact as previously told to them ). They also offered no explanation as to why my original two emails to them asking for help went unreturned. I was told the reason I could n't claim my money was that my cell phone number had not been confirmed. However according to the PayPal mobile app, the number is confirmed. When I log into the website, I attempt to "" re-confirm '' my cell phone number and nothing happens. The PayPal website deceptively and unfairly tells me they will text my phone with a code to confirm my number but the text never comes through. I did however, receive a text from PayPal stating that the money was not claimed fast enough and they returned it to the sender. 

I request that 1. PayPal 's marketing claims on their website be investigated as clearly they advertise a higher level of technology than they can deliver. 2. PayPal 's mobile app discrepancies be investigated as clearly the mobile app which I relied on provided false information regarding the status of my cell phone 3. PayPal 's complaint process be reviewed as they did not give proper time to respond to their voicemail ( 1 business day ) before closing my file and returning the money I was sent to the sender. 4. Pay Pal 's email address be removed from their site since they do not respond to emails, it is clearly on their site just for marketing purposes to offer consumers false faith in their brand that they can email should something go wrong.

06/09/2016,Money transfers,International money transfer,Other service issues,,"I made an international purchase on eBay and attempted to make payment via PayPal. PayPal automatically defaults to having the money taken from your bank account, and you have to click additional screens to have it changed to credit card. When I attempted to make the payment the first time via credit card, the transaction was declined by my credit card company ( potential fraudulent transaction ). I immediately called my credit card company to authenticate myself and authorize the charge. The credit card company cleared the block from my account, and I kept them on the line while I attempted payment again. The second transaction went through, but unfortunately I noticed after submitting payment that PayPal had re-defaulted the funding source to my bank account instead of my credit card. As such, the transaction was processed out of my bank account instead of using my credit card as I originally specified. I called their customer service, and was on hold for XXXX minutes before talking to a representative, who told me she could n't help me, but could escalate me to their dispute resolution department, who could reverse the charge/withdrawal from my Bank account, and allow me to re-process the transaction with my credit card. I had to wait on hold for a further XXXX minutes for someone in that department, only to have them tell me once connected there was nothing they could do. Their only resolution was to have me dispute the charge with the eBay seller, who would hopefully refund my money and then I could process the transaction again. As I do n't want the eBay seller to think I 'm the one being an unreliable and deceptive business partner, I let the transfer from my bank account stand. 
I believe PayPal 's business practices are unfair, deceptive, and abusive for the following reasons : 1 ) Defaulting payment method to Bank account : the consumer should be able to permanently specify the default funding source, rather than having it always default to the linked bank account and having to change it for every transaction. I believe PayPal does this so that, by making other funding sources more difficult, they will have to pay fewer interchange fees for credit card processing, which increases their profit margins ( for business transactions, PayPal charges the recipient of the funds interchange fees regardless of the funding source, so if funded from a Bank account this difference goes straight into their pockets ). This also reduces the consumer protections available to the purchaser, since you then have to follow PayPal dispute processes if you have problems with the transaction ( which are generally not as favorable to the consumer than what is required by regulation and/or offered by most credit cards ), instead of having credit card protections in addition to PayPal dispute mechanisms. 
2 ) When processing international transactions through PayPal and funded from a Bank account, PayPal discloses the exchange rate you will receive, and deducts dollars from your Bank account. However, they do not clearly disclose at the time of the transaction that this exchange rate includes an embedded 3 % foreign transaction fee, nor give you the option of charging your bank account directly in the foreign currency. Transactions funded from a credit card are charged in the foreign currency. My bank account only charges a 2 % foreign transaction fee, and my credit card only charges a 1 % fee. By defaulting payment to my bank account and/or not giving me the option of charging my bank directly in the foreign currency, my transaction cost me more than it otherwise would have, to PayPal 's direct enrichment. 
3 ) Not unfair, deceptive, and abusive per se, but making customer service contact numbers difficult to find on the PayPal site and having wait times approaching an hour likely have the result of discouraging consumers from exercising their rights.",,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",UT,840XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/09/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1961774

PayPal does not even let you know beforehand that they engage in this type of unfair and deceptive trade practice with any degree of notice ( I am a XXXX for 15 years and even I missed any notice, if there even was any, so I can not imagine a XXXX knowing about this ).

Despite the call-center representative saying that my account has been open since 2014, there are no statements available on the website and this is the first time I have ever had a charge go to this account.

06/19/2016,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"On XXXX/XXXX/16, I sold XXXX wristbands on eBay for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/2016. In my eBay post to sell the wristbands, I said, "" This is for XXXX unregistered wristbands and a free day parking pass. '' Following the end of the auction, I shipped both wristbands faster than I promised ( two days instead of seven ) to the buyer via XXXX. I messaged the buyer first via eBay and then her personal email to watch for the package to arrive so she could sign for it. She indicated she was at the XXXX XXXX and would n't be home for another week. The buyer requested XXXX redirect the wristbands to another XXXX office, presumably closer to her. The wristbands sat at that office for nine days without the buyer picking them up. Five days before the start of the festival, XXXX delivered the wristbands back to the original XXXX office. On XXXX/XXXX/16 - two days before the start of the festival - I spoke with eBay customer service, inquiring if and when I would be paid. PayPal was holding the money the buyer paid, and the buyer was n't picking up the wristbands. On XXXX/XXXX/16, the buyer 's funds were released to my PayPal account. One day prior to the opening of the festival, on XXXX/XXXX/16, the buyer picked up the wristbands at the original XXXX office. On XXXX/XXXX/16, the opening day of the festival, I happened to check my email around XXXX. The buyer had emailed me at XXXX. saying she could not get into the festival : "" I 'm at bonnaroo and they say the bands do n't work, like they 've been reported stolen. Can you send proof of purchase? We drove from Nebraska and are at the gate excited to get in. '' I had not reported the wristbands as lost or stolen. My guess is the buyer had not registered the wristbands, which is required by the festival for entry. Just 30 minutes after sending her first email, I received an email from PayPal saying the dispute had been escalated to a claim because the items were "" not as described. '' I was unaware there was even a dispute. As requested by the buyer, I forwarded my receipt of original purchase, asked if she had registered the wristbands, and included XXXX 's instructions for doing so. Per their request in the claim, I immediately uploaded everything I had to PayPal regarding this transaction. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I called PayPal and asked about the status of the case, as the festival had ended the previous day. I was told I would be contacted if PayPal needed additional information. On the morning of XXXX/XXXX/16, I awoke to discover via email that the case had been decided in favor of the buyer, the case was closed, and {$740.00} had been debited from my PayPal account. PayPal did not tell me why they had ruled in the buyer 's favor. They did not provide me with proof that the items I shipped were "" not as described '' as claimed. They also did not provide me with proof that the buyer was unable to eventually enter the festival with the wristbands I provided. I contacted PayPal via phone on XXXX/XXXX/16 and spoke with a dispute supervisor. He reviewed the case and said PayPal could not overturn their decision. He did not tell me why. I called eBay on XXXX/XXXX/16 and spoke with someone who identified himself as a supervisor. He said since the buyer had filed the claim through PayPal, there was nothing eBay could do to refund my money. Now, I have neither the wristbands nor the money.

I contacted the seller of the snow mobile and we exchanged conversation over the next week or so about the product, and purchasing it. The seller wanted me to wire him the money ( {$5000.00} ) but I did not feel safe buying something in another country by just wiring funds. I requested him to send me an invoice via PayPal as I assumed that PayPal was the safest way to make the payment in the event there was issues I would be protected and can easily file a dispute with PayPal to be protected. He was n't happy with receiving PayPal as a form of payment, but he did send me an invoice of {$5200.00} as I instructed him to so that he has the additional {$200.00} to cover the fees that PayPal will charge to receive the funds. 
After sending payment, I proceeded with trying to schedule my drive out to XXXX to pick up the snow mobile. Being a XXXX hour drive ( each way ) from XXXX OH where I am from, I wanted to ensure everything was in order for the long trip. 
He had told me the town he resided in, but never the exact address. I asked him numerous times, and his response was 'just head up here, I 'll give it to you when you are close '. I did not want to drive XXXX hours to not have an address of where to go to, especially crossing the border incase I was questioned for the drive when pulling a trailer. Within an hour of starting the drive, and insisting I received an actual address, the seller then stated that he either needed more money for the snow mobile due to PayPal fees ( which was incorrect ) or that he needed cash instead. Having already sent him the {$5200.00} which was already deducted from my account, and being a weekend, I was n't able to go and withdraw another {$5000.00}, especially since he had not refunded me the original payment. If he wanted me to bring cash, he could have easily refunded the payment, and I would have been able to reschedule the trip and bring actual cash if necessary. 
Since we did not come to terms on the purchase, I decided to turn back around and head home. 
Once I returned I asked him to issue a refund, which he ignored. I asked numerous time, stating that I would file a dispute with PayPal if he had not refunded me, which he also ignored. 
I file a dispute, later escalating it to a claim. The seller attached a tracking number in his answer to the dispute filed, and upon receiving the box that he had sent and attached a tracking number of in PayPal, the contents of the box were as follows : ( picture of box and contents also included in evidence pictures herein ) XXXX XXXX, bag of XXXX chips, hand cream, toy XXXX wheeler, picture of the sled being purchased inside XXXX XXXX, and disinfectant wipes. 
The claim got turned down via PayPal as they stated that this has to do with the purchase of a 'motor vehicle ' and they do not govern, not does a purchase of such fall under their buyer protection terms. 
I have filed a Police Report with my local Enforcement Agency, as well as made a Claim to the Ohio Attorney Generals Office. That claim number with the Attorney Generals Office is XXXX, filed on XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I wish to file the claim here as this is absolutely a form of fraud this individual has committed, as well as to prevent him from doing so in the future as he seems like someone who will again and again after what seems like he is getting away with quite easily.

07/11/2016,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"I 've been a member of the eBay and PayPal community since 2000. I only sell things intermittently but have run into serious and costly problems only recently. I listed several XXXX XXXX XXXX collector item statues on eBay for sale in their online auctions, all used with descriptive pictures. Every one of them sold and as eBay forces you to use PayPal for all of your transactions as a seller, I also had to use this service to transfer money. eBay and PayPal charge a 15 % fee between them, raking in lots of money. In my auctions, I listed that I do not accept returns or refunds and all items are as is. I also stated the requirements of my auctions, XXXX Mail XXXX shipping, damage insurance and signature delivery, and of course, no international sales. After receiving these items sent by insured mail, I began to receive notices of 'not delivered ' or that a buyer is complaining due to 'item not being as described '. I accepted XXXX items as a return due to damage and filed insurance claims, not because I wanted to but because both eBay and PayPal literally forced me to. PayPal withheld funds from my balance and even forced me to take refunds in situations I found were to be fraudulent. Despite proving that I was being defrauded and even their customer service agreeing with me and claiming 'that buyer has done it to many others ', they ruled in favor of the buyer and forced me to accept refunds on these items. As if that was n't bad enough, they send messages to the buyer telling them to keep the items. Now I 'm out for the loss they take from my paypal balance, or even hitting my bank account, and the collectible that I was forced to take back is still in the hands of the buyer that defrauded me. Not to mention, the fees totaling a minimum of 15 % of the selling price, I still have to pay. This is blatant fraud, but their response is to hide behind their unconscionable user agreement I never signed. Simply because I logged into their website, I supposedly agreed to their terms. I did n't agree to be defrauded, or to lose my things and have to give a refunds, plus pay fees. I look online and see various websites that are laden with comments that eBay and PayPal find in favor of the buyer in nearly every single issue. All a buyer has to do is to claim they did n't receive something at all ( despite their signature on the package from USPS ), or that the item they purchased was n't received 'as described ' and they automatically issue a refund before any other notification is given to the seller. No matter what evidence is presented, they issue a refund, then they tell the buyer to keep the item! I see what the CFPB does with debt collection companies, this is no different. They are acting as a third party and enabling fraud with disregard for the law. They must be stopped! I see various state lawsuits for XXXX violations and even fraud, but this belongs to the CFPB! Please get involved in this, they 've cost me well over {$1000.00} in less than a month.

As I have learned, XXXX ( a subsidiary of XXXX ) collects and processes ACHs through Chase Bank. I do not have nor have I ever had any accounts with XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I notice an unauthorized debit for {$2000.00} from my XXXX account from "" XXXX PYMT '', which overdrew my checking account by about {$500.00}. I go down to a XXXX Branch in New Hampshire and tell an employee about this ( I think the branch manager ), and I am told in no uncertain terms that ACH transactions that are currently pending ca n't be disputed, and that there is absolutely nothing that can be done until it posts, which will occur the next business day. I was instructed to return the next day to file a dispute in writing ( the XXXX ) which I did. 

A week passed and I still did not see a refund applied to my XXXX account. I soon got a letter from XXXX, claiming that I really did authorize the transaction, and that my attempt to reverse the transaction was denied. Of course, I researched further, since this was plainly false. 

I received a copy of the discussion between XXXX and Chase bank ( attached ). XXXX opens the discussion by stating to Chase bank that XXXX customer ( me ) was claiming that this transaction for {$2000.00} was unauthorized. XXXX requested that Chase either return the money to them or to fax XXXX their evidence suggesting that I approved of the transaction. 

JP Morgan Chase replied by providing them with a paper containing numerous identification and trace numbers. What it did not contain was my signature or my voice authorization to debit the account. In fact, the second sentence of Chase 's reply to XXXX was this : "" Please notify J.P Morgan if the receiving client is disputing its validity and requesting a return. '' I reported XXXX to the CFPB, which is ongoing. 

Money was fraudulently debited from my account from XXXX XXXX to pay a car loan that is not in my name. Chase bank processes payments for XXXX, since they are n't an actual real bank. Thus, Chase made an unauthorized withdrawal from my checking account at the request of XXXX XXXX, and then credited that withdrawal to XXXX XXXX, who in turn credited it to whatever customers of theirs paid their car loan with it. 

I did not authorize Chase ( or anyone else ) to withdraw this money from my account. Chase responded to XXXX notification that the customer whose XXXX account they debited was alleging the transaction was unauthorized not by returning my money to XXXX, but with a "" proof of authorization '' that contains transaction numbers and descriptions, but no actual proof ( voice or signature or anything ) suggesting that I approved the transaction. The second sentence of this reply to XXXX request for Chase to reverse the unauthorized transaction actually suggests they are unaware that XXXX customer "" is disputing its validity and requesting a return. '' Despite Chase 's inability to provide any evidence that I authorized the withdrawal of {$2000.00} they made from my account, XXXX decided to rule that this transaction was authorized. When Chase bank received this dispute notification, they should have either provided evidence that I did in fact authorize the transaction ( which they ca n't, because I did n't ) or give the money back to XXXX so XXXX can return it to me. Instead, they sent XXXX not the money they should have returned, but the letter I attached describing the transaction, trace number, amount et cetera, and that did not appear to comprehend XXXX original claim that their customer was claiming that the transaction was UNAUTHORIZED. 

When Chase was notified by XXXX that XXXX customer from whom Chase debited {$2000.00} was claiming that the debit was UNAUTHORIZED, Chase should have returned the money to XXXX immediately based on Chase 's lack of evidence that I made this transaction.",,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,MA,015XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/17/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2016076

PayPal fails to inform consumers and myself of the reason ( s ) for the actions PayPal has taken, even telling Consumers "" have to get a subpoena '' to learn the simple information as to why PayPal is holding, and denying my/their access to, our own money. 

2. Paypal 's apparent justification for these 180 day expropriations is an expansive interpretation of a provision of the Paypal User Agreement ( the "" Agreement '' ) which allows them "" in its sole discretion '' to place a "" Reserve '' on funds held in certain types of accounts where Paypal believes that there "" may be a high level of risk associated with our/your account. '' 3. However, Paypal violates its own agreement by imposing the holds on mine/users ' accounts where it has no reason to believe there is a "" high level of risk '' associated with mine and/or users account or transactions. 
Paypal further violates its own Agreement by failing to provide adequate notice to me or users ' whose accounts have had holds placed on them. When Paypal informed me and other individuals ' whose funds are being held of the holds, it does not inform us why such funds are being held, how they can reasonably obtain a release of the hold, and/or how they can avoid future holds being placed on their accounts. The Agreement requires Paypal to, at a minimum, provide notice to such users of any holds placed on their accounts that includes both the reason for the hold and an opportunity to request restoration of access to the held funds. Paypal 's "" notice '' falls far short of what is required. As a result, I nor other consumer 's have no idea why our money is "" held '' by Paypal.",,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",MI,483XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,08/01/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2040823

I had not sent money to this relative in many years, so I had to fill out a form with Western Union to be able to send the money. When my relative tried to cash the money transfer, he was denied the funds, but not given a reason why. When I got involved, a representative told me that either he submitted an official ID through e-mail to western union ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ), fax it, OR we had to send a letter of explanation to Western Union with a picture of my signature. There were problems with both options : my relatives in XXXX do not have the technology or the know how to e-mail the picture ID, and the letter of explanation had to be accompanied with many details I do not know about my relative, and that I know well he would n't be willing to give me. These were facts such as date and place of birth, occupation, address, etc. I must mention here that while I have a moral obligation to assist this relative, our relationship is not the best. So I decided to cancel the money transfer, with the intention to re-send it to another mutual relative who is in my Western Union profile and receives money transfers without any difficulty. She could in turn deliver the funds to the original intended recipient. This is the part with which I have a problem : Western Union stated that that was n't an option at all. How is that possible? Either my estranged relative submitted an ID, which I was not even sure he had, and he stated that it would be too difficult for him, or I submitted the letter of explanation. Else, according to Western Union, they would keep the funds for a year and then submit it to the Treasury Department. 
This defied any sense of logic. It was my money and I simply wanted to cancel the transaction. I called back to seek an explanation ( was it a regulatory requirement or simply an internal policy? What gave them the power to simply keep my money? ) I was NOT given a reasonable explanation. Their explanation was basically "" that is the process.

08/13/2016,Money transfers,International money transfer,Incorrect/missing disclosures or info,,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I sent money from my checking account ( XXXX Bank, XXXX, Texas ) to an XXXX bank account using the website Xoom.com. The money got deposited in the XXXX bank account alright, but it supposedly got rejected by my American account ( the aforementioned XXXX XXXX account ). 

Now Xoom.com is threatening me with legal steps if I do n't pay the entire amount ( approx. XXXX XXXX dollars ) to them IMMEDIATELY. 

But 1. I do n't have ( like I LITERALLY do n't have ) XXXX XXXX dollars right now, even if someone holds a XXXX to my head or something! 


2. I 've explicitly told Xoom ( in writing ) that I fully intend to pay back the entire amount to them ASAP. But the best I can do is pay it in monthly installments of {$300.00} or {$400.00} ( at most ). But Xoom rejected my proposal and is continuing to harass me. 


3. Since the transactions had perfectly gone through at that point of time ( on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), I had naturally assumed that everything was settled, Xoom and I were good, and there was nothing else to take care of. I thus planned my finances accordingly and made other expenditures thereafter. 

Now if Xoom suddenly comes knocking on my door, how am I supposed to conjure the money out of thin air?! Especially when the amount is equal to five entire months ' worth of my ENTIRE salary!!! 


4. During the original transactions on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, if the money had n't indeed cleared from the source account ( my XXXX XXXX account ), how the XXXX did it land up in the destination account ( the XXXX recipient account )?? Is n't Xoom itself supposed to ensure that nothing of this sort happens?! If Xoom did n't have the money from the customer ( myself in this case ) to begin with, then why did n't it decline the transaction in the first place??!!! I mean, like, any online merchant would do if you try to make a purchase with your credit card that will result in your credit limit being exceeded?!! Such declined transactions take place all the time, are n't they?!! Then why did n't Xoom do itself and me the favor of declining the transactions for which it 's now harassing me?!! 

I mean, if an ordinary citizen has to keep track of all the mundane arithmetic related to his/her finances, then what 're the banks / financial institutions there for?! To rip money off the ordinary citizen and to make the economy come crashing down ( like in XXXX ) from time to time? 


5. I 'm a XXXX living on my XXXX of XXXX XXXX dollars per month. {$300.00} or {$400.00} per month is the maximum amount I can spare to pay off the supposed "" debt '' or whatever it 's called by Xoom. I 'm an honest, conscientious, industrious ( I have a GPA of XXXX at school as well as XXXX ) person. I do n't want to be living with a debt either, but I ca n't come up with money that I do n't have ( that is, the money that I do n't earn in this first place! ) I 'm sticking with my assurance to Xoom that I 'll pay back the entire amount as soon as I can, but if it continues to hold a XXXX to my head ( figuratively speaking ), I 'd LITERALLY have to XXXX.",,Xoom,TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,08/17/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2062400

I initiated the transfer, and the money was debited from my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I learned from the recipient that I had misspelled her email address and the money never reached her. I immediately called Wells Fargo and notified them of the issue. They gave me a claim number and told me it would be 10 business days before the claim was resolved. I never received anything in my Wells account confirming I had filed a claim. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and remarked that I had a claim number, but no acknowledgement from Wells that I had filed a claim. I was again told '10 business days ' to resolve the claim. 
Several days later, I did receive a notice in the mail that a claim had been filed. 
I waited the 10 business days and called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX as I had not been updated or informed of a resolution. During the course of speaking with several different representatives, I learned XXXX things : 1 ) the claim had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX as Wells had not been able to reach a representative of the Credit Union where the money ended up ( I was NOT notified the claim had been closed ) and 2 ) one of the representatives gave me the trace # of the transfer and the phone number and name of the credit union where the funds ended up, as if I was supposed to call and get my money back. 
I was on the phone with Wells Fargo for almost XXXX minutes and was told explicitly that my claim had been referred to the case management section for review and the Executive office for review. I was also told I could expect someone from the executive office to be contacting me, even on Saturday. I told the representative that I was not happy with the way the claim had been handled thus far, and asked if Wells Fargo really wanted me to go to the CFPB with all the publicity in the air currently. I indicated if my claim was not resolved by the end of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I would submit a complaint to the CFPB. He understood and definitely did not want that to happen. The only thing I did receive was a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX updating me with a status, which was 'we are working on it ' and there is n't even an expected completion date. One of the items in the letter indicates they may contact institution ( s ) involved in an effort to obtain the money. Well, as indicated above, they KNOW where the money is, they have the trace number and the name of the institution. The funds were intended for XXXX XXXX, not a CU in Colorado! 
In re-reading the disclosures involved with Surepay, there is an indication that if the funds are not cashed by the recipient within 14 days, the funds are returned to the originating account. The recipient has obviously not cashed the funds, so by the terms of the account, they should return the funds to my account. 
In speaking with the representatives, I indicated that the best course of action would be for Wells to credit my money back to me and keep pursuing the other institution for the funds. I can not believe the 4th largest bank in the US gave up on getting my funds back because, as they said, 'they could not reach the representative at the credit union who processed the transfer '. SERIOUSLY? That is their answer? I find that to be ludicrous, to think a customer would actually let this go because Wells ca n't reach someone by phone!! That is almost as ludicrous as them expecting ME to call the Credit Union myself to get my money back. 
I know this caused by an error on my part, however Wells has done NOTHING to rectify the situation except pass the buck and make noncommittal responses.

I am not necessarily requesting that my account be re-opened or allowed to continue to use the PayPal service, as I have already taken my business one of your largest competitors that I am no longer in need of PayPal 's services. 

I have been made aware that the limitation on the account can not be appealed. Although I disagree with the decision to close my account to future business I will abide by it - however because I feel that holding my funds for 180 days for a non-fraudulent violation of PayPal 's Acceptable Use Policy is excessive, and perhaps a punitive abuse of power, I will be filing complaints with the attorney general of California, as well as the DBO of California in order for them to mediate and decide whether this practice is acceptable in my specific case. Additionally, i am not satisfied with the current response to hold my interest bearing money for 180 days solely at the discretion and best interest of Paypal for monetary benefit and security purposes. 

I understand PayPal 's need for holding funds for credit card chargeback purposes, however due to the sheer amount of customers compared to the rate of claims I feel that any reasonable person would conclude that holding my entire balance for 180 days is excessive and may be viewed by some as punitive or as already stated, an unnecessary abuse of power and perhaps even contrary to the laws of some states. That being said I have no problem with, and agree to leaving a balance of {$500.00} for credit card chargeback purposes for the duration of the 180 days. I feel that this is a fair resolution while still leaving PayPal with the means to charge back any future credit card disputes to my account. 

Should you remain to not release my cleared funds, please provide to me a lawful reason that allows you to hold my money for 180days? I do not wish to wait 180 days nor is this a reasonable amount of time to continue to operate a business in the same manner with cashflow disrupted due to gross negligence and lack of information regarding limitations. Proof of past gross negligence can be seen in XXXX PayPal Inc., XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX California XXXX where Plaintiffs allege that PayPal improperly handled disputed transactions on PayPal accounts and improperly placed holds and reserves on accounts or closed or suspended accounts. 

Section 1841 of the state 's Money Transmission Act reads : "" Every licensee or its agent shall forward all money received for transmission or give instructions committing equivalent money to the person designated by the customer within 10 days after receiving that money, unless otherwise ordered by his or her customer.

This is a serious and onerous breach of trust and SECURITY since the aforementioned bank, Chase, recently experience a massive breach in security, requiring them to cancel all their cards and issue new ones with added security. 

In light of this fact, it seems to me the height of arrogance, insolence, aloofness, superciliousness, chutzpah and disdain by the bank, to subject the customer and the customers financial friends to a third party and unknown security credentials without permission. 
I am extremely disappointed in Chase and their behavior. They are always asking for feedback and customer satisfaction, but I see now that all is is merely lip service and means very little. If they truly were concerned with the well being of their customers, they could have, and would have asked for the customers opinion and carefully weighed the customers concern and explained the matter, instead of acting in such an imperious and 19th Century provincial, highhanded and uncaring manor.

We have been told by Citi Prepaid that the transfer left our account and should have been received on XX/XX/2016. Over a month ago Citi Prepaid informed us it was being elevated to their own personal investigations department and that we would hear from them regarding the status of our investigation. 

During this time frame we have heard nothing aside from that it is being investigated. We have been given zero updates with no regard for any questions we have risen concerning the status of this ongoing investigation. 

This is highly concerning as now we are worried that the money is lost or stolen and we have no support from Citi Prepaid Services in tracking the missing transfer. Their costumer services supervisor, XXXX, Informed us they can not give us a tracking number or any information, which seems unbelievable and suspicious. 

The effects of this situation go beyond just our missing money. My partner and I are damaging our credit ratings by the day, and due to a total lack of confidence in Citi Prepaid 's transfer system we are afraid to move more money into our personal accounts.

When the scammer wanted to withdraw the funds, Bank of America could have said "" there is a concern regarding these funds so we did put a temporary hold until we clarify the situation '' - I am sure any customer would be OK with that, I know I would. I understand you can not arrest them or take money from their account, but you could have worked with local police to have the right authorities solve the issue if you had limitations on what you could do. None of that happened.

Bill Pay does not meet requirement of account to account direct transfer from XXXX bank to another.

I was sent a bad wire transfer from someone I trusted. 
I was clues less as to it being fraudulent. 
I trusted him. 
He owed me a small amount and without my knowledge bet put in XXXX. He texted me, did you get money and I looked an was shocked. I was only expected what he owed me. 

When I asked him he asked me for a favor because he was in XXXX in a remote place and needed help covering his employee 's payroll to put in his biz account with XXXX XXXX XXXX most of money. It seemed legitimate. so I did it. 
I think it is legitimate money not understanding this kind of criminal activity. Not on my radar at all. 
So I did it and thought it was done and okay Then XXXX bank recalls the wire and the money is gone so they freeze all my account including XXXX XXXX account who is my son and XXXX money as I am monitoring and teaching him. 
Meanwhile chase keeps keeping me in a run around and I keep calling many dept trying to get answers. No one really talks to me and investigators call leave a message and a number but never get on phone with me. 
They are taking XXXX money too and sending it to XXXX bank. He had nothing to do with this fraud scam The so called person who sent the wire tried to send more without my knowledge and this is happening Tuesday after first wire XXXX. I informed him the first wire was recalled and question him, but he had some reason that it must be how he sent the wire and he would call his bank and try and fix it. Nothing got fixed. 
Finally, I found someone at a local branch to help me That Friday XXXX XXXX and got an internal investigator to tell me the action they took. They are sending all the money in my accounts and sons back to XXXX and I do not have a say. Only then did I find out a wire was sent from a woman I dont know. I was flabbergasted it was not the person I thought he was. It took me the week to put a few of the pieces together but I still do not know how this happened on XXXX bank end and how he did this or who that female is.

They are not concerned that this is so serious and such a breach. I do not think it 's XXXX laundering money but it crossed my mind, as it should the banks but it questionable as this is pretty well set up crime and is very scary. The banks seem very irresponsible.

Then for this coming XX/XX/XXXX scheduled payment, Citibank charged us {$25.00} interest alleging that the free interest outstanding balance of {$3000.00} had expired on XX/XX/XXXX. This was not our understanding ; our understanding of the agreement as discussed over the phone was that the balance of the old loan had become part of the interest free outstanding loan of {$8200.00} payable effective XX/XX/XXXX. It was not disclosed to us that the old loan of {$3000.00} free interest feature continues only up to XX/XX/XXXX and that after XX/XX/XXXX we will be charged of interest. There was a fraudulent intention to trap us into paying interest. Because of this entrapment, I declared to Citibank Supervisor that we are not paying this fraudulent interest charge and be part of Citibank conspiracy to defraud consumers. 
The previous Citibank Supervisor offered some kind of solution that he would forego the interest charge if we pay the balance of the first interest free loan. Today I called Citibank and spoke to another responding Supervisor named XXXX that we are paying the remaining balance of the first interest free loan as suggested by the previous Supervisor. Supervisor XXXX declined telling us there was no such offer of adjustment by the previous Supervisor. This rude Supervisor XXXX did not know that we recorded what transpired which exposes him as a liar. He claimed he is the authority representing Citibank when I asked to speak to his superior. If this is so, Citibank then is determined to scalp consumers for even a miserable amount of interest of as little as $ XXXX/mo but probably amounts to $ millions/mo for thousands of consumers it dopes like me and my wife.

The non-disclosure was a violation of the disclosure law. The other reason why we do not want to pay this fraudulent interest is that we do not want to be a willing participant to Citibank 's conspiracy to defraud innocent consumers like us.

'' ( A ) It 's a computer-generated error but it 's not necessary to add money to Wallet because we automatically deduct from your linked bank account if transaction amount exceeds your Wallet balance. 
[ Then what is the point of having "" Add Money '' from a linked bank account? If this service does not apply to all, do n't customers have a right to know why? It seems like these people are trained to give canned responses - instead of answering the question, they would respond with "" you do n't need to add money anymore since we charge your bank directly ... ''!! They double-down with "" it is to your benefit and for your protection '' etc.!! Customers should make their own decisions as to whether a service is to their benefit or not! By the way, they are the worst in terms of being customer-friendly. They sound exactly the opposite '' ] ( B ) Of course it 's possible to add money to Wallet. Let 's do this again. 
[ Then they take you thru a series of security checks related to your publicly available information. After successfully passing these checks, they ask you to retry. Of course it failed! Then they say, well, give some time for computer system to refresh after a few hours. It still failed ] My point is that PayPal has become extremely customer-UNfriendly and they are not transparent at all about issues regarding their products and services. I would rather, and I 'm sure most of their customers would agree with me, see PayPal become more transparent by completely removing "" Add Money From Bank '' service and charge the bank whenever a transaction exceeds PayPal 's Wallet balance. Or, if they decide to keep the service, then be forthright with their customers and tell them exactly why they are not able to add money after consistent failures. To me, it appears that they are doing stuff behind the scene that are unfair, unethical and are based on malpractice.",,"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",MA,021XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/29/2016,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,2139343

Now, everything is done online, but I needed to redo my password and other activities to even get access to my accounts. And lo and behold, CIT Bank has deleted our previously linked external bank accounts for transfer of funds. CIT Bank has been transferring funds to this bank for years, even as last at XX/XX/2016. Now, it is non-existent and I have to start all over and go through testing, etc. That means my time and attention for problems that they have caused. At this point, I am not confident that this system will work as they say it will. It will be very easy for them to say that they did not get the message. Yes, now I have to send a message through their customer service message center to request that the account be closed on maturity and transferred to an external account. Of course I can not do that until my external account has been tested and approved. I truly do not like fighting for my money.

I received a call from their escalations team in which I was told there would be no refund or letter.
